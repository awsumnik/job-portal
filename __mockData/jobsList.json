        "description": "GluCare was born out of the idea that a combination of a human-centric patient approach and a technology working together will lead to a better and more efficient management of diabetes and metabolic syndrome. \n\nThe GluCare team is looking to expand their successful business model from physical interaction to service in the cloud. This new offering will be called Zone.Health. The ask is to build a website that acts as the hub of information in order to get patients to join their program. The various sections of the site will consist of: \n\nâ€¢\tâ—  What is Zone.health? \nâ€¢\tâ—  The program \nâ€¢\tâ—  Why it works? \nâ€¢\tâ—  Join now \nâ€¢\tâ—  Pricing \nâ€¢\tâ—  FAQs \n\nWe envisage the website to have an onboarding portal which will consist of three parts, an API, a CMS and a Frontend system.\n\n1.\tThis will allow for future integration into other customer touch points should the need arise. The onboarding journey will consist of: \n\n1) BMI calculator\n\nIf less 27, show a message to say that they donâ€™t qualify. If greater 27, take the user through the registration flow. \n\n2) Registration (numerous inputs)\n\nOnce the patient has provided the above, they will be visible within the custom built CMS. The practitioner will have a login to the CMS whereby they will be able to view the information captured by the patient. They would be able to add specific notes after the consultation and select the medication and the required gear (glucose monitor, wearable and scale) to send to the patient. The idea is that the cost of these items will be built into the system, so that the practitioner can simply select the products, which then creates the payment link. This will be centrally managed in its totality in the CMS. \nOnce the payment has been made, the kit will be delivered to the patient and the engagement with Zone.Health will be through the app. However, each month, the practitioner will log into the CMS and create a payment link based on the progress the patient is making. \n\nAll invoices and orders will be available to the patient when logging into the site. It is important to note that the onboarding portal and the mobile app (this has been developed separately and not in the scope of this project) should use the same authentication system in order to prevent the patient having to create two seperate accounts. \nDetails will be provided once engagement starts, but we expect the website to consist of:\n\no\tâ—  Project set up \no\tâ—  Information website build \no\tâ—  BMI \no\tâ—  Registration \no\tâ—  Further screening questions \no\tâ—  Laboratory Test Uploads \no\tâ—  Schedule a visit \no\tâ—  Confirmation \no\tâ—  Payment Process \no\tâ—  Account Settings \no\tâ—  CMS - View users \no\tâ—  CMS - Create payments \no\tâ—  CMS - Shipment of your ZoneHealth kit notification \no\tâ—  Email Templates Creation \no\tâ—  Email Provider Integration \no\tâ—  CRM Integration \no\tâ—  Scheduling System Integration \no\tâ—  Payment Provider Integration \nVideo Conferencing Integration \n\nThere are similar businesses in the US and we like this the most: https://joinfound.com\n\n",

        "description": "I have a 3D modding application for Final Fantasy VII, and itâ€™s missing critical animation tools. The main things I think it's missing are a Gizmo to move and rotate joints in 3D space, animation splines to make adjustments to direction and speed, and a real animation bar at the bottom displaying your key frames and etc. It's also lacking automatic interpolation between the keys so you can play test the animation without manually adding additional frames, this makes it much harder if you need an animation\nto stay within a certain number of frames. The app has an animation retargeting feature, but it could probably be rounded out a bit more to work more like Maya or Unreal. If possible, it would be helpful to make the app platform agnostic so it can work on both Windows and Mac. If thatâ€™s too much reworking, then maybe just a Mac version as well. This isnâ€™t an absolute necessity, I currently use the app with Wine, but an app that can work natively would be much better. \n\nI didnâ€™t set a budget because Iâ€™m not sure what something like this would cost, and I didnâ€™t want to discourage anyone from applying. If youâ€™re interested let me know what you think, and how much you think you could complete this for. \n\nThe source code and application is here: \n\nhttps://github.com/LaZar00/KimeraCS\n",

        "description": "GluCare was born out of the idea that a combination of a human-centric patient approach and a technology working together will lead to a better and more efficient management of diabetes and metabolic syndrome. \n\nThe GluCare team is looking to expand their successful business model from physical interaction to service in the cloud. This new offering will be called Zone.Health. The ask is to build a website that acts as the hub of information in order to get patients to join their program. The various sections of the site will consist of: \n\nâ€¢\tâ—  What is Zone.health? \nâ€¢\tâ—  The program \nâ€¢\tâ—  Why it works? \nâ€¢\tâ—  Join now \nâ€¢\tâ—  Pricing \nâ€¢\tâ—  FAQs \n\nWe envisage the website to have an onboarding portal which will consist of three parts, an API, a CMS and a Frontend system.\n\n1.\tThis will allow for future integration into other customer touch points should the need arise. The onboarding journey will consist of: \n\n1) BMI calculator\n\nIf less 27, show a message to say that they donâ€™t qualify. If greater 27, take the user through the registration flow. \n\n2) Registration (numerous inputs)\n\nOnce the patient has provided the above, they will be visible within the custom built CMS. The practitioner will have a login to the CMS whereby they will be able to view the information captured by the patient. They would be able to add specific notes after the consultation and select the medication and the required gear (glucose monitor, wearable and scale) to send to the patient. The idea is that the cost of these items will be built into the system, so that the practitioner can simply select the products, which then creates the payment link. This will be centrally managed in its totality in the CMS. \nOnce the payment has been made, the kit will be delivered to the patient and the engagement with Zone.Health will be through the app. However, each month, the practitioner will log into the CMS and create a payment link based on the progress the patient is making. \n\nAll invoices and orders will be available to the patient when logging into the site. It is important to note that the onboarding portal and the mobile app (this has been developed separately and not in the scope of this project) should use the same authentication system in order to prevent the patient having to create two seperate accounts. \nDetails will be provided once engagement starts, but we expect the website to consist of:\n\no\tâ—  Project set up \no\tâ—  Information website build \no\tâ—  BMI \no\tâ—  Registration \no\tâ—  Further screening questions \no\tâ—  Laboratory Test Uploads \no\tâ—  Schedule a visit \no\tâ—  Confirmation \no\tâ—  Payment Process \no\tâ—  Account Settings \no\tâ—  CMS - View users \no\tâ—  CMS - Create payments \no\tâ—  CMS - Shipment of your ZoneHealth kit notification \no\tâ—  Email Templates Creation \no\tâ—  Email Provider Integration \no\tâ—  CRM Integration \no\tâ—  Scheduling System Integration \no\tâ—  Payment Provider Integration \nVideo Conferencing Integration \n\nThere are similar businesses in the US and we like this the most: https://joinfound.com\n\n",

        "description": "I have a 3D modding application for Final Fantasy VII, and itâ€™s missing critical animation tools. The main things I think it's missing are a Gizmo to move and rotate joints in 3D space, animation splines to make adjustments to direction and speed, and a real animation bar at the bottom displaying your key frames and etc. It's also lacking automatic interpolation between the keys so you can play test the animation without manually adding additional frames, this makes it much harder if you need an animation\nto stay within a certain number of frames. The app has an animation retargeting feature, but it could probably be rounded out a bit more to work more like Maya or Unreal. If possible, it would be helpful to make the app platform agnostic so it can work on both Windows and Mac. If thatâ€™s too much reworking, then maybe just a Mac version as well. This isnâ€™t an absolute necessity, I currently use the app with Wine, but an app that can work natively would be much better. \n\nI didnâ€™t set a budget because Iâ€™m not sure what something like this would cost, and I didnâ€™t want to discourage anyone from applying. If youâ€™re interested let me know what you think, and how much you think you could complete this for. \n\nThe source code and application is here: \n\nhttps://github.com/LaZar00/KimeraCS\n",

        "description": "I have an interactive website that needs to be updated. The purpose of the site is to collect comments from users who are directed to the site. I would like a freelancer to propose a price for this work.  \n\nAt the site users log in with a username and password that I provide. The project to which they are assigned opens and user then adds one or more comments. There are multiple projects and multiple users so that login credentials ensures that the user accesses the correct project. I have admin rights on the site to set up projects, set up users, assign users to projects and download data collected. I need to make clear that I am not a website administrator, nor do I have deep skills in the technology. While I am tech savvy in a number of areas, and I have managed many tech development projects through Upwork and the predecessor companies. The freelancer will need to communicate with me at my level of understanding. \n\nThe site has not been used much recently and the code is now out of date. Most parts of the site seem to work ok except when a user logs in, their project does not open. I need a freelancer to review the code and update the site (patches, fixes, etc.). I do not need a redesign or new functionality; I only need the code updated. I do have more detailed documentation that I can share with freelancers that are shortlisted. The freelancer who created the site did great work but they are not available at this time so I need a new freelancer who can do this work. \n\nI have accounts on Heroku and Vercel to support this site and the below is a brief summary of the documentation from the freelancer that created the project.\nLIBRARIES &amp; FRAMEWORKS ON THE FRONT END\nReact JS - React is an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components.\nNext JS â€“ Was used to build server-side rendering and static web applications using React.\nStyled-Components â€“ This utilizes tagged template literals to style the components.\nMaterial-UI - React components for faster and easier web development.\nJs-Cookie â€“ Is a simple, lightweight JavaScript API for handling browser cookies, this was used to read the cookie token stored in the browser and was used for authenticating users as soon as they are signed in using the form on the application.\nIsormorphic-Fetch - Isomorphic-fetch is implementation of fetch for both Node.js and browser, this was used to communicate with the backend (server) and used to fetch data stored on the server database and pulled to the frontend.\nThe rest of the libraries/frameworks can be found in the package.json file on the root directory of the project. Any developer that will be doing further work on the project can find the documentation on the README.MD file on the GitHub page useful and straightforward.\n\nLIBRARIES &amp; FRAMEWORKS ON THE BACK END\nNode JS â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side.\nExpress JS â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side.\nMongoose â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code \nJson2cvs â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side.\n\n\n \n",

        "description": "I have a 3D modding application for Final Fantasy VII, and itâ€™s missing critical animation tools. The main things I think it's missing are a Gizmo to move and rotate joints in 3D space, animation splines to make adjustments to direction and speed, and a real animation bar at the bottom displaying your key frames and etc. It's also lacking automatic interpolation between the keys so you can play test the animation without manually adding additional frames, this makes it much harder if you need an animation\nto stay within a certain number of frames. The app has an animation retargeting feature, but it could probably be rounded out a bit more to work more like Maya or Unreal. If possible, it would be helpful to make the app platform agnostic so it can work on both Windows and Mac. If thatâ€™s too much reworking, then maybe just a Mac version as well. This isnâ€™t an absolute necessity, I currently use the app with Wine, but an app that can work natively would be much better. \n\nI didnâ€™t set a budget because Iâ€™m not sure what something like this would cost, and I didnâ€™t want to discourage anyone from applying. If youâ€™re interested let me know what you think, and how much you think you could complete this for. \n\nThe source code and application is here: \n\nhttps://github.com/LaZar00/KimeraCS\n",

We do not expect you to create art from scratch, but we definitely need a website that looks like our own. You will need moderate graphic design skills.\n\nWe will have a screen where we showcase the app features and another screen where we'll add informative blogs. That is all, it's not a big project.\n\nSEO knowledge is important, not because we'll try to push high on organic ranking but at least because we want to do something that does not go against the ranking algorithm.\n\nIf you have made any projects for mobile application landing pages, please do share. We'll look at each of them and it will have a big impact on our decision.\n\nThat's pretty much it, if I'm missing anything please ask. I'll respond as fast as I can.",

I would like a freelancer to propose a price for this work.  \n\nAt the site users log in with a username and password that I provide. The project to which they are assigned opens and user then adds one or more comments. There are multiple projects and multiple users so that login credentials ensures that the user accesses the correct project. I have admin rights on the site to set up projects, set up users, assign users to projects and download data collected. I need to make clear that I am not a website administrator, nor do I have deep skills in the technology. While I am tech savvy in a number of areas, and I have managed many tech development projects through Upwork and the predecessor companies. The freelancer will need to communicate with me at my level of understanding. \n\nThe site has not been used much recently and the code is now out of date. Most parts of the site seem to work ok except when a user logs in, their project does not open. I need a freelancer to review the code and update the site (patches, fixes, etc.). I do not need a redesign or new functionality; I only need the code updated. I do have more detailed documentation that I can share with freelancers that are shortlisted. The freelancer who created the site did great work but they are not available at this time so I need a new freelancer who can do this work. \n\nI have accounts on Heroku and Vercel to support this site and the below is a brief summary of the documentation from the freelancer that created the project.\nLIBRARIES &amp; FRAMEWORKS ON THE FRONT END\nReact JS - React is an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components.\nNext JS â€“ Was used to build server-side rendering and static web applications using React.\nStyled-Components â€“ This utilizes tagged template literals to style the components.\nMaterial-UI - React components for faster and easier web development.\nJs-Cookie â€“ Is a simple, lightweight JavaScript API for handling browser cookies, this was used to read the cookie token stored in the browser and was used for authenticating users as soon as they are signed in using the form on the application.\nIsormorphic-Fetch - Isomorphic-fetch is implementation of fetch for both Node.js and browser, this was used to communicate with the backend (server) and used to fetch data stored on the server database and pulled to the frontend.\nThe rest of the libraries/frameworks can be found in the package.json file on the root directory of the project. Any developer that will be doing further work on the project can find the documentation on the README.MD file on the GitHub page useful and straightforward.\n\nLIBRARIES &amp; FRAMEWORKS ON THE BACK END\nNode JS â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side.\nExpress JS â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side.\nMongoose â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code \nJson2cvs â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side.\n\n\n \n",

I think we need to extrapolate that based on the number of rows but I'm not sure, so I need your help to figure this out. I was having trouble because the dataset is too large to open it all at once in Excel.\n\nOnce you know the number rides coming *out* of each zone/neighborhood:\n\n1. Break the data down and put it into excel based on all the categories that they have already tagged the data with but do it by zone/neighborhood: \n\nRides by Hour of Day (All Days)\t\nRides  by Hour of Day (Weekdays Only)\t\nRides  by Hour of Day (Weekends Only)\t\nRides  by Day of Week\t\nRides  by Month (All Days)\t\nRides  by Month (Weekdays Only)\t\nRides  by Month (Weekends Only)\t\nRides  By Date By Hour Buckets (All Days)\n\n2.

The requirements are to create a Flow with the Flow Designer corresponding to a provided Visio Diagram.\nThe flow is triggered by a Catalog Item and has some if conditions that trigger on the selections the user does on previous tasks on the variables.\nFurther, there should be Notifications triggered by events at the right places in the Flow with dynamic variables included.\nAlso it is necessary to show specific variables on the Service Portal but hide them on the Ritm and task and also to make variables read only or mandatory depending on Service Portal / Ritm or Task level.\nSince the requirements are not set entirely a little bit creativity is needed. But the underlying focus is always that the Client is satisfied. \nWhen there are questions I can support and help with implementation questions or design.\n\nYou should also know how update sets work.\n\nThe Project takes about 40h And will end at mid September the latest.\n\nFeel free to apply,\nMax\n\n\n",

Our current website is ugly and not worth the paid advertisement. \n\nWe are looking for customization. We do not expect you to create art from scratch, but we definitely need a website that looks like our own. You will need moderate graphic design skills.\n\nWe will have a screen where we showcase the app features and another screen where we'll add informative blogs. That is all, it's not a big project.\n\nSEO knowledge is important, not because we'll try to push high on organic ranking but at least because we want to do something that does not go against the ranking algorithm.\n\nIf you have made any projects for mobile application landing pages, please do share. We'll look at each of them and it will have a big impact on our decision.\n\nThat's pretty much it, if I'm missing anything please ask. I'll respond as fast as I can.",

I would like a freelancer to propose a price for this work.  \n\nAt the site users log in with a username and password that I provide. The project to which they are assigned opens and user then adds one or more comments. There are multiple projects and multiple users so that login credentials ensures that the user accesses the correct project. I have admin rights on the site to set up projects, set up users, assign users to projects and download data collected. I need to make clear that I am not a website administrator, nor do I have deep skills in the technology. While I am tech savvy in a number of areas, and I have managed many tech development projects through Upwork and the predecessor companies. The freelancer will need to communicate with me at my level of understanding. \n\nThe site has not been used much recently and the code is now out of date. Most parts of the site seem to work ok except when a user logs in, their project does not open. I need a freelancer to review the code and update the site (patches, fixes, etc.). I do not need a redesign or new functionality; I only need the code updated. I do have more detailed documentation that I can share with freelancers that are shortlisted. The freelancer who created the site did great work but they are not available at this time so I need a new freelancer who can do this work. \n\nI have accounts on Heroku and Vercel to support this site and the below is a brief summary of the documentation from the freelancer that created the project.\nLIBRARIES &amp; FRAMEWORKS ON THE FRONT END\nReact JS - React is an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components.\nNext JS â€“ Was used to build server-side rendering and static web applications using React.\nStyled-Components â€“ This utilizes tagged template literals to style the components.\nMaterial-UI - React components for faster and easier web development.\nJs-Cookie â€“ Is a simple, lightweight JavaScript API for handling browser cookies, this was used to read the cookie token stored in the browser and was used for authenticating users as soon as they are signed in using the form on the application.\nIsormorphic-Fetch - Isomorphic-fetch is implementation of fetch for both Node.js and browser, this was used to communicate with the backend (server) and used to fetch data stored on the server database and pulled to the frontend.\nThe rest of the libraries/frameworks can be found in the package.json file on the root directory of the project. Any developer that will be doing further work on the project can find the documentation on the README.MD file on the GitHub page useful and straightforward.\n\nLIBRARIES &amp; FRAMEWORKS ON THE BACK END\nNode JS â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side.\nExpress JS â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side.\nMongoose â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code \nJson2cvs â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side.\n\n\n \n",

        "description": "Dear ServiceNow Developer,\n\nfor my Client I need some support in a project. The requirements are to create a Flow with the Flow Designer corresponding to a provided Visio Diagram.\nThe flow is triggered by a Catalog Item and has some if conditions that trigger on the selections the user does on previous tasks on the variables.\nFurther, there should be Notifications triggered by events at the right places in the Flow with dynamic variables included.\nAlso it is necessary to show specific variables on the Service Portal but hide them on the Ritm and task and also to make variables read only or mandatory depending on Service Portal / Ritm or Task level.\nSince the requirements are not set entirely a little bit creativity is needed. But the underlying focus is always that the Client is satisfied. \nWhen there are questions I can support and help with implementation questions or design.\n\nYou should also know how update sets work.\n\nThe Project takes about 40h And will end at mid September the latest.\n\nFeel free to apply,\nMax\n\n\n",

        "description": "GluCare was born out of the idea that a combination of a human-centric patient approach and a technology working together will lead to a better and more efficient management of diabetes and metabolic syndrome. \n\nThe GluCare team is looking to expand their successful business model from physical interaction to service in the cloud. This new offering will be called Zone.Health. The ask is to build a website that acts as the hub of information in order to get patients to join their program. The various sections of the site will consist of: \n\nâ€¢\tâ—  What is Zone.health? \nâ€¢\tâ—  The program \nâ€¢\tâ—  Why it works? \nâ€¢\tâ—  Join now \nâ€¢\tâ—  Pricing \nâ€¢\tâ—  FAQs \n\nWe envisage the website to have an onboarding portal which will consist of three parts, an API, a CMS and a Frontend system.\n\n1.\tThis will allow for future integration into other customer touch points should the need arise. The onboarding journey will consist of: \n\n1) BMI calculator\n\nIf less 27, show a message to say that they donâ€™t qualify. If greater 27, take the user through the registration flow. \n\n2) Registration (numerous inputs)\n\nOnce the patient has provided the above, they will be visible within the custom built CMS. The practitioner will have a login to the CMS whereby they will be able to view the information captured by the patient. They would be able to add specific notes after the consultation and select the medication and the required gear (glucose monitor, wearable and scale) to send to the patient. The idea is that the cost of these items will be built into the system, so that the practitioner can simply select the products, which then creates the payment link. This will be centrally managed in its totality in the CMS. \nOnce the payment has been made, the kit will be delivered to the patient and the engagement with Zone.Health will be through the app. However, each month, the practitioner will log into the CMS and create a payment link based on the progress the patient is making. \n\nAll invoices and orders will be available to the patient when logging into the site. It is important to note that the onboarding portal and the mobile app (this has been developed separately and not in the scope of this project) should use the same authentication system in order to prevent the patient having to create two seperate accounts. \nDetails will be provided once engagement starts, but we expect the website to consist of:\n\no\tâ—  Project set up \no\tâ—  Information website build \no\tâ—  BMI \no\tâ—  Registration \no\tâ—  Further screening questions \no\tâ—  Laboratory Test Uploads \no\tâ—  Schedule a visit \no\tâ—  Confirmation \no\tâ—  Payment Process \no\tâ—  Account Settings \no\tâ—  CMS - View users \no\tâ—  CMS - Create payments \no\tâ—  CMS - Shipment of your ZoneHealth kit notification \no\tâ—  Email Templates Creation \no\tâ—  Email Provider Integration \no\tâ—  CRM Integration \no\tâ—  Scheduling System Integration \no\tâ—  Payment Provider Integration \nVideo Conferencing Integration \n\nThere are similar businesses in the US and we like this the most: https://joinfound.com\n\n",

The requirements are to create a Flow with the Flow Designer corresponding to a provided Visio Diagram.\nThe flow is triggered by a Catalog Item and has some if conditions that trigger on the selections the user does on previous tasks on the variables.\nFurther, there should be Notifications triggered by events at the right places in the Flow with dynamic variables included.\nAlso it is necessary to show specific variables on the Service Portal but hide them on the Ritm and task and also to make variables read only or mandatory depending on Service Portal / Ritm or Task level.\nSince the requirements are not set entirely a little bit creativity is needed. But the underlying focus is always that the Client is satisfied. \nWhen there are questions I can support and help with implementation questions or design.\n\nYou should also know how update sets work.\n\nThe Project takes about 40h And will end at mid September the latest.\n\nFeel free to apply,\nMax\n\n\n",

This new offering will be called Zone.Health. The ask is to build a website that acts as the hub of information in order to get patients to join their program. The various sections of the site will consist of: \n\nâ€¢\tâ—  What is Zone.health? \nâ€¢\tâ—  The program \nâ€¢\tâ—  Why it works? \nâ€¢\tâ—  Join now \nâ€¢\tâ—  Pricing \nâ€¢\tâ—  FAQs \n\nWe envisage the website to have an onboarding portal which will consist of three parts, an API, a CMS and a Frontend system.\n\n1.\tThis will allow for future integration into other customer touch points should the need arise. The onboarding journey will consist of: \n\n1) BMI calculator\n\nIf less 27, show a message to say that they donâ€™t qualify. If greater 27, take the user through the registration flow. \n\n2) Registration (numerous inputs)\n\nOnce the patient has provided the above, they will be visible within the custom built CMS. The practitioner will have a login to the CMS whereby they will be able to view the information captured by the patient. They would be able to add specific notes after the consultation and select the medication and the required gear (glucose monitor, wearable and scale) to send to the patient.

But the underlying focus is always that the Client is satisfied. \nWhen there are questions I can support and help with implementation questions or design.\n\nYou should also know how update sets work.\n\nThe Project takes about 40h And will end at mid September the latest.\n\nFeel free to apply,\nMax\n\n\n",

But the underlying focus is always that the Client is satisfied. \nWhen there are questions I can support and help with implementation questions or design.\n\nYou should also know how update sets work.\n\nThe Project takes about 40h And will end at mid September the latest.\n\nFeel free to apply,\nMax\n\n\n",

I think we need to extrapolate that based on the number of rows but I'm not sure, so I need your help to figure this out. I was having trouble because the dataset is too large to open it all at once in Excel.\n\nOnce you know the number rides coming *out* of each zone/neighborhood:\n\n1.

        "description": "I have a 3D modding application for Final Fantasy VII, and itâ€™s missing critical animation tools. The main things I think it's missing are a Gizmo to move and rotate joints in 3D space, animation splines to make adjustments to direction and speed, and a real animation bar at the bottom displaying your key frames and etc. It's also lacking automatic interpolation between the keys so you can play test the animation without manually adding additional frames, this makes it much harder if you need an animation\nto stay within a certain number of frames. The app has an animation retargeting feature, but it could probably be rounded out a bit more to work more like Maya or Unreal. If possible, it would be helpful to make the app platform agnostic so it can work on both Windows and Mac. If thatâ€™s too much reworking, then maybe just a Mac version as well. This isnâ€™t an absolute necessity, I currently use the app with Wine, but an app that can work natively would be much better. \n\nI didnâ€™t set a budget because Iâ€™m not sure what something like this would cost, and I didnâ€™t want to discourage anyone from applying. If youâ€™re interested let me know what you think, and how much you think you could complete this for. \n\nThe source code and application is here: \n\nhttps://github.com/LaZar00/KimeraCS\n",

        "description": "GluCare was born out of the idea that a combination of a human-centric patient approach and a technology working together will lead to a better and more efficient management of diabetes and metabolic syndrome. \n\nThe GluCare team is looking to expand their successful business model from physical interaction to service in the cloud. This new offering will be called Zone.Health. The ask is to build a website that acts as the hub of information in order to get patients to join their program. The various sections of the site will consist of: \n\nâ€¢\tâ—  What is Zone.health? \nâ€¢\tâ—  The program \nâ€¢\tâ—  Why it works? \nâ€¢\tâ—  Join now \nâ€¢\tâ—  Pricing \nâ€¢\tâ—  FAQs \n\nWe envisage the website to have an onboarding portal which will consist of three parts, an API, a CMS and a Frontend system.\n\n1.\tThis will allow for future integration into other customer touch points should the need arise. The onboarding journey will consist of: \n\n1) BMI calculator\n\nIf less 27, show a message to say that they donâ€™t qualify. If greater 27, take the user through the registration flow. \n\n2) Registration (numerous inputs)\n\nOnce the patient has provided the above, they will be visible within the custom built CMS. The practitioner will have a login to the CMS whereby they will be able to view the information captured by the patient. They would be able to add specific notes after the consultation and select the medication and the required gear (glucose monitor, wearable and scale) to send to the patient. The idea is that the cost of these items will be built into the system, so that the practitioner can simply select the products, which then creates the payment link. This will be centrally managed in its totality in the CMS. \nOnce the payment has been made, the kit will be delivered to the patient and the engagement with Zone.Health will be through the app. However, each month, the practitioner will log into the CMS and create a payment link based on the progress the patient is making. \n\nAll invoices and orders will be available to the patient when logging into the site. It is important to note that the onboarding portal and the mobile app (this has been developed separately and not in the scope of this project) should use the same authentication system in order to prevent the patient having to create two seperate accounts. \nDetails will be provided once engagement starts, but we expect the website to consist of:\n\no\tâ—  Project set up \no\tâ—  Information website build \no\tâ—  BMI \no\tâ—  Registration \no\tâ—  Further screening questions \no\tâ—  Laboratory Test Uploads \no\tâ—  Schedule a visit \no\tâ—  Confirmation \no\tâ—  Payment Process \no\tâ—  Account Settings \no\tâ—  CMS - View users \no\tâ—  CMS - Create payments \no\tâ—  CMS - Shipment of your ZoneHealth kit notification \no\tâ—  Email Templates Creation \no\tâ—  Email Provider Integration \no\tâ—  CRM Integration \no\tâ—  Scheduling System Integration \no\tâ—  Payment Provider Integration \nVideo Conferencing Integration \n\nThere are similar businesses in the US and we like this the most: https://joinfound.com\n\n",

        "description": "GluCare was born out of the idea that a combination of a human-centric patient approach and a technology working together will lead to a better and more efficient management of diabetes and metabolic syndrome. \n\nThe GluCare team is looking to expand their successful business model from physical interaction to service in the cloud. This new offering will be called Zone.Health. The ask is to build a website that acts as the hub of information in order to get patients to join their program. The various sections of the site will consist of: \n\nâ€¢\tâ—  What is Zone.health? \nâ€¢\tâ—  The program \nâ€¢\tâ—  Why it works? \nâ€¢\tâ—  Join now \nâ€¢\tâ—  Pricing \nâ€¢\tâ—  FAQs \n\nWe envisage the website to have an onboarding portal which will consist of three parts, an API, a CMS and a Frontend system.\n\n1.\tThis will allow for future integration into other customer touch points should the need arise. The onboarding journey will consist of: \n\n1) BMI calculator\n\nIf less 27, show a message to say that they donâ€™t qualify. If greater 27, take the user through the registration flow. \n\n2) Registration (numerous inputs)\n\nOnce the patient has provided the above, they will be visible within the custom built CMS. The practitioner will have a login to the CMS whereby they will be able to view the information captured by the patient. They would be able to add specific notes after the consultation and select the medication and the required gear (glucose monitor, wearable and scale) to send to the patient. The idea is that the cost of these items will be built into the system, so that the practitioner can simply select the products, which then creates the payment link. This will be centrally managed in its totality in the CMS. \nOnce the payment has been made, the kit will be delivered to the patient and the engagement with Zone.Health will be through the app. However, each month, the practitioner will log into the CMS and create a payment link based on the progress the patient is making. \n\nAll invoices and orders will be available to the patient when logging into the site. It is important to note that the onboarding portal and the mobile app (this has been developed separately and not in the scope of this project) should use the same authentication system in order to prevent the patient having to create two seperate accounts. \nDetails will be provided once engagement starts, but we expect the website to consist of:\n\no\tâ—  Project set up \no\tâ—  Information website build \no\tâ—  BMI \no\tâ—  Registration \no\tâ—  Further screening questions \no\tâ—  Laboratory Test Uploads \no\tâ—  Schedule a visit \no\tâ—  Confirmation \no\tâ—  Payment Process \no\tâ—  Account Settings \no\tâ—  CMS - View users \no\tâ—  CMS - Create payments \no\tâ—  CMS - Shipment of your ZoneHealth kit notification \no\tâ—  Email Templates Creation \no\tâ—  Email Provider Integration \no\tâ—  CRM Integration \no\tâ—  Scheduling System Integration \no\tâ—  Payment Provider Integration \nVideo Conferencing Integration \n\nThere are similar businesses in the US and we like this the most: https://joinfound.com\n\n",

        "description": "GluCare was born out of the idea that a combination of a human-centric patient approach and a technology working together will lead to a better and more efficient management of diabetes and metabolic syndrome. \n\nThe GluCare team is looking to expand their successful business model from physical interaction to service in the cloud. This new offering will be called Zone.Health. The ask is to build a website that acts as the hub of information in order to get patients to join their program. The various sections of the site will consist of: \n\nâ€¢\tâ—  What is Zone.health? \nâ€¢\tâ—  The program \nâ€¢\tâ—  Why it works? \nâ€¢\tâ—  Join now \nâ€¢\tâ—  Pricing \nâ€¢\tâ—  FAQs \n\nWe envisage the website to have an onboarding portal which will consist of three parts, an API, a CMS and a Frontend system.\n\n1.\tThis will allow for future integration into other customer touch points should the need arise. The onboarding journey will consist of: \n\n1) BMI calculator\n\nIf less 27, show a message to say that they donâ€™t qualify. If greater 27, take the user through the registration flow. \n\n2) Registration (numerous inputs)\n\nOnce the patient has provided the above, they will be visible within the custom built CMS. The practitioner will have a login to the CMS whereby they will be able to view the information captured by the patient. They would be able to add specific notes after the consultation and select the medication and the required gear (glucose monitor, wearable and scale) to send to the patient. The idea is that the cost of these items will be built into the system, so that the practitioner can simply select the products, which then creates the payment link. This will be centrally managed in its totality in the CMS. \nOnce the payment has been made, the kit will be delivered to the patient and the engagement with Zone.Health will be through the app. However, each month, the practitioner will log into the CMS and create a payment link based on the progress the patient is making. \n\nAll invoices and orders will be available to the patient when logging into the site. It is important to note that the onboarding portal and the mobile app (this has been developed separately and not in the scope of this project) should use the same authentication system in order to prevent the patient having to create two seperate accounts. \nDetails will be provided once engagement starts, but we expect the website to consist of:\n\no\tâ—  Project set up \no\tâ—  Information website build \no\tâ—  BMI \no\tâ—  Registration \no\tâ—  Further screening questions \no\tâ—  Laboratory Test Uploads \no\tâ—  Schedule a visit \no\tâ—  Confirmation \no\tâ—  Payment Process \no\tâ—  Account Settings \no\tâ—  CMS - View users \no\tâ—  CMS - Create payments \no\tâ—  CMS - Shipment of your ZoneHealth kit notification \no\tâ—  Email Templates Creation \no\tâ—  Email Provider Integration \no\tâ—  CRM Integration \no\tâ—  Scheduling System Integration \no\tâ—  Payment Provider Integration \nVideo Conferencing Integration \n\nThere are similar businesses in the US and we like this the most: https://joinfound.com\n\n",

Our current website is ugly and not worth the paid advertisement. \n\nWe are looking for customization. We do not expect you to create art from scratch, but we definitely need a website that looks like our own. You will need moderate graphic design skills.\n\nWe will have a screen where we showcase the app features and another screen where we'll add informative blogs. That is all, it's not a big project.\n\nSEO knowledge is important, not because we'll try to push high on organic ranking but at least because we want to do something that does not go against the ranking algorithm.\n\nIf you have made any projects for mobile application landing pages, please do share. We'll look at each of them and it will have a big impact on our decision.\n\nThat's pretty much it, if I'm missing anything please ask. I'll respond as fast as I can.",

        "description": "GluCare was born out of the idea that a combination of a human-centric patient approach and a technology working together will lead to a better and more efficient management of diabetes and metabolic syndrome. \n\nThe GluCare team is looking to expand their successful business model from physical interaction to service in the cloud. This new offering will be called Zone.Health. The ask is to build a website that acts as the hub of information in order to get patients to join their program. The various sections of the site will consist of: \n\nâ€¢\tâ—  What is Zone.health? \nâ€¢\tâ—  The program \nâ€¢\tâ—  Why it works? \nâ€¢\tâ—  Join now \nâ€¢\tâ—  Pricing \nâ€¢\tâ—  FAQs \n\nWe envisage the website to have an onboarding portal which will consist of three parts, an API, a CMS and a Frontend system.\n\n1.\tThis will allow for future integration into other customer touch points should the need arise. The onboarding journey will consist of: \n\n1) BMI calculator\n\nIf less 27, show a message to say that they donâ€™t qualify. If greater 27, take the user through the registration flow. \n\n2) Registration (numerous inputs)\n\nOnce the patient has provided the above, they will be visible within the custom built CMS. The practitioner will have a login to the CMS whereby they will be able to view the information captured by the patient. They would be able to add specific notes after the consultation and select the medication and the required gear (glucose monitor, wearable and scale) to send to the patient. The idea is that the cost of these items will be built into the system, so that the practitioner can simply select the products, which then creates the payment link. This will be centrally managed in its totality in the CMS. \nOnce the payment has been made, the kit will be delivered to the patient and the engagement with Zone.Health will be through the app. However, each month, the practitioner will log into the CMS and create a payment link based on the progress the patient is making. \n\nAll invoices and orders will be available to the patient when logging into the site. It is important to note that the onboarding portal and the mobile app (this has been developed separately and not in the scope of this project) should use the same authentication system in order to prevent the patient having to create two seperate accounts. \nDetails will be provided once engagement starts, but we expect the website to consist of:\n\no\tâ—  Project set up \no\tâ—  Information website build \no\tâ—  BMI \no\tâ—  Registration \no\tâ—  Further screening questions \no\tâ—  Laboratory Test Uploads \no\tâ—  Schedule a visit \no\tâ—  Confirmation \no\tâ—  Payment Process \no\tâ—  Account Settings \no\tâ—  CMS - View users \no\tâ—  CMS - Create payments \no\tâ—  CMS - Shipment of your ZoneHealth kit notification \no\tâ—  Email Templates Creation \no\tâ—  Email Provider Integration \no\tâ—  CRM Integration \no\tâ—  Scheduling System Integration \no\tâ—  Payment Provider Integration \nVideo Conferencing Integration \n\nThere are similar businesses in the US and we like this the most: https://joinfound.com\n\n",

        "description": "I have an interactive website that needs to be updated. The purpose of the site is to collect comments from users who are directed to the site. I would like a freelancer to propose a price for this work.  \n\nAt the site users log in with a username and password that I provide. The project to which they are assigned opens and user then adds one or more comments. There are multiple projects and multiple users so that login credentials ensures that the user accesses the correct project. I have admin rights on the site to set up projects, set up users, assign users to projects and download data collected. I need to make clear that I am not a website administrator, nor do I have deep skills in the technology. While I am tech savvy in a number of areas, and I have managed many tech development projects through Upwork and the predecessor companies. The freelancer will need to communicate with me at my level of understanding. \n\nThe site has not been used much recently and the code is now out of date. Most parts of the site seem to work ok except when a user logs in, their project does not open. I need a freelancer to review the code and update the site (patches, fixes, etc.). I do not need a redesign or new functionality; I only need the code updated. I do have more detailed documentation that I can share with freelancers that are shortlisted. The freelancer who created the site did great work but they are not available at this time so I need a new freelancer who can do this work. \n\nI have accounts on Heroku and Vercel to support this site and the below is a brief summary of the documentation from the freelancer that created the project.\nLIBRARIES &amp; FRAMEWORKS ON THE FRONT END\nReact JS - React is an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components.\nNext JS â€“ Was used to build server-side rendering and static web applications using React.\nStyled-Components â€“ This utilizes tagged template literals to style the components.\nMaterial-UI - React components for faster and easier web development.\nJs-Cookie â€“ Is a simple, lightweight JavaScript API for handling browser cookies, this was used to read the cookie token stored in the browser and was used for authenticating users as soon as they are signed in using the form on the application.\nIsormorphic-Fetch - Isomorphic-fetch is implementation of fetch for both Node.js and browser, this was used to communicate with the backend (server) and used to fetch data stored on the server database and pulled to the frontend.\nThe rest of the libraries/frameworks can be found in the package.json file on the root directory of the project. Any developer that will be doing further work on the project can find the documentation on the README.MD file on the GitHub page useful and straightforward.\n\nLIBRARIES &amp; FRAMEWORKS ON THE BACK END\nNode JS â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side.\nExpress JS â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side.\nMongoose â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code \nJson2cvs â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side.\n\n\n \n",

        "description": "GluCare was born out of the idea that a combination of a human-centric patient approach and a technology working together will lead to a better and more efficient management of diabetes and metabolic syndrome. \n\nThe GluCare team is looking to expand their successful business model from physical interaction to service in the cloud. This new offering will be called Zone.Health. The ask is to build a website that acts as the hub of information in order to get patients to join their program. The various sections of the site will consist of: \n\nâ€¢\tâ—  What is Zone.health? \nâ€¢\tâ—  The program \nâ€¢\tâ—  Why it works? \nâ€¢\tâ—  Join now \nâ€¢\tâ—  Pricing \nâ€¢\tâ—  FAQs \n\nWe envisage the website to have an onboarding portal which will consist of three parts, an API, a CMS and a Frontend system.\n\n1.\tThis will allow for future integration into other customer touch points should the need arise. The onboarding journey will consist of: \n\n1) BMI calculator\n\nIf less 27, show a message to say that they donâ€™t qualify. If greater 27, take the user through the registration flow. \n\n2) Registration (numerous inputs)\n\nOnce the patient has provided the above, they will be visible within the custom built CMS. The practitioner will have a login to the CMS whereby they will be able to view the information captured by the patient. They would be able to add specific notes after the consultation and select the medication and the required gear (glucose monitor, wearable and scale) to send to the patient. The idea is that the cost of these items will be built into the system, so that the practitioner can simply select the products, which then creates the payment link. This will be centrally managed in its totality in the CMS. \nOnce the payment has been made, the kit will be delivered to the patient and the engagement with Zone.Health will be through the app. However, each month, the practitioner will log into the CMS and create a payment link based on the progress the patient is making. \n\nAll invoices and orders will be available to the patient when logging into the site. It is important to note that the onboarding portal and the mobile app (this has been developed separately and not in the scope of this project) should use the same authentication system in order to prevent the patient having to create two seperate accounts. \nDetails will be provided once engagement starts, but we expect the website to consist of:\n\no\tâ—  Project set up \no\tâ—  Information website build \no\tâ—  BMI \no\tâ—  Registration \no\tâ—  Further screening questions \no\tâ—  Laboratory Test Uploads \no\tâ—  Schedule a visit \no\tâ—  Confirmation \no\tâ—  Payment Process \no\tâ—  Account Settings \no\tâ—  CMS - View users \no\tâ—  CMS - Create payments \no\tâ—  CMS - Shipment of your ZoneHealth kit notification \no\tâ—  Email Templates Creation \no\tâ—  Email Provider Integration \no\tâ—  CRM Integration \no\tâ—  Scheduling System Integration \no\tâ—  Payment Provider Integration \nVideo Conferencing Integration \n\nThere are similar businesses in the US and we like this the most: https://joinfound.com\n\n",

The requirements are to create a Flow with the Flow Designer corresponding to a provided Visio Diagram.\nThe flow is triggered by a Catalog Item and has some if conditions that trigger on the selections the user does on previous tasks on the variables.\nFurther, there should be Notifications triggered by events at the right places in the Flow with dynamic variables included.\nAlso it is necessary to show specific variables on the Service Portal but hide them on the Ritm and task and also to make variables read only or mandatory depending on Service Portal / Ritm or Task level.\nSince the requirements are not set entirely a little bit creativity is needed. But the underlying focus is always that the Client is satisfied. \nWhen there are questions I can support and help with implementation questions or design.\n\nYou should also know how update sets work.\n\nThe Project takes about 40h And will end at mid September the latest.\n\nFeel free to apply,\nMax\n\n\n",

I would like a freelancer to propose a price for this work.  \n\nAt the site users log in with a username and password that I provide. The project to which they are assigned opens and user then adds one or more comments. There are multiple projects and multiple users so that login credentials ensures that the user accesses the correct project. I have admin rights on the site to set up projects, set up users, assign users to projects and download data collected. I need to make clear that I am not a website administrator, nor do I have deep skills in the technology. While I am tech savvy in a number of areas, and I have managed many tech development projects through Upwork and the predecessor companies. The freelancer will need to communicate with me at my level of understanding. \n\nThe site has not been used much recently and the code is now out of date. Most parts of the site seem to work ok except when a user logs in, their project does not open. I need a freelancer to review the code and update the site (patches, fixes, etc.). I do not need a redesign or new functionality; I only need the code updated. I do have more detailed documentation that I can share with freelancers that are shortlisted. The freelancer who created the site did great work but they are not available at this time so I need a new freelancer who can do this work. \n\nI have accounts on Heroku and Vercel to support this site and the below is a brief summary of the documentation from the freelancer that created the project.\nLIBRARIES &amp; FRAMEWORKS ON THE FRONT END\nReact JS - React is an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components.\nNext JS â€“ Was used to build server-side rendering and static web applications using React.\nStyled-Components â€“ This utilizes tagged template literals to style the components.\nMaterial-UI - React components for faster and easier web development.\nJs-Cookie â€“ Is a simple, lightweight JavaScript API for handling browser cookies, this was used to read the cookie token stored in the browser and was used for authenticating users as soon as they are signed in using the form on the application.\nIsormorphic-Fetch - Isomorphic-fetch is implementation of fetch for both Node.js and browser, this was used to communicate with the backend (server) and used to fetch data stored on the server database and pulled to the frontend.\nThe rest of the libraries/frameworks can be found in the package.json file on the root directory of the project. Any developer that will be doing further work on the project can find the documentation on the README.MD file on the GitHub page useful and straightforward.\n\nLIBRARIES &amp; FRAMEWORKS ON THE BACK END\nNode JS â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side.\nExpress JS â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side.\nMongoose â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code \nJson2cvs â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side.\n\n\n \n",

I would like a freelancer to propose a price for this work.  \n\nAt the site users log in with a username and password that I provide. The project to which they are assigned opens and user then adds one or more comments. There are multiple projects and multiple users so that login credentials ensures that the user accesses the correct project. I have admin rights on the site to set up projects, set up users, assign users to projects and download data collected. I need to make clear that I am not a website administrator, nor do I have deep skills in the technology. While I am tech savvy in a number of areas, and I have managed many tech development projects through Upwork and the predecessor companies. The freelancer will need to communicate with me at my level of understanding. \n\nThe site has not been used much recently and the code is now out of date. Most parts of the site seem to work ok except when a user logs in, their project does not open. I need a freelancer to review the code and update the site (patches, fixes, etc.). I do not need a redesign or new functionality; I only need the code updated. I do have more detailed documentation that I can share with freelancers that are shortlisted. The freelancer who created the site did great work but they are not available at this time so I need a new freelancer who can do this work. \n\nI have accounts on Heroku and Vercel to support this site and the below is a brief summary of the documentation from the freelancer that created the project.\nLIBRARIES &amp; FRAMEWORKS ON THE FRONT END\nReact JS - React is an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components.\nNext JS â€“ Was used to build server-side rendering and static web applications using React.\nStyled-Components â€“ This utilizes tagged template literals to style the components.\nMaterial-UI - React components for faster and easier web development.\nJs-Cookie â€“ Is a simple, lightweight JavaScript API for handling browser cookies, this was used to read the cookie token stored in the browser and was used for authenticating users as soon as they are signed in using the form on the application.\nIsormorphic-Fetch - Isomorphic-fetch is implementation of fetch for both Node.js and browser, this was used to communicate with the backend (server) and used to fetch data stored on the server database and pulled to the frontend.\nThe rest of the libraries/frameworks can be found in the package.json file on the root directory of the project. Any developer that will be doing further work on the project can find the documentation on the README.MD file on the GitHub page useful and straightforward.\n\nLIBRARIES &amp; FRAMEWORKS ON THE BACK END\nNode JS â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side.\nExpress JS â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side.\nMongoose â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code \nJson2cvs â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side.\n\n\n \n",

The main things I think it's missing are a Gizmo to move and rotate joints in 3D space, animation splines to make adjustments to direction and speed, and a real animation bar at the bottom displaying your key frames and etc. It's also lacking automatic interpolation between the keys so you can play test the animation without manually adding additional frames, this makes it much harder if you need an animation\nto stay within a certain number of frames. The app has an animation retargeting feature, but it could probably be rounded out a bit more to work more like Maya or Unreal. If possible, it would be helpful to make the app platform agnostic so it can work on both Windows and Mac. If thatâ€™s too much reworking, then maybe just a Mac version as well. This isnâ€™t an absolute necessity, I currently use the app with Wine, but an app that can work natively would be much better. \n\nI didnâ€™t set a budget because Iâ€™m not sure what something like this would cost, and I didnâ€™t want to discourage anyone from applying. If youâ€™re interested let me know what you think, and how much you think you could complete this for. \n\nThe source code and application is here: \n\nhttps://github.com/LaZar00/KimeraCS\n",

The main things I think it's missing are a Gizmo to move and rotate joints in 3D space, animation splines to make adjustments to direction and speed, and a real animation bar at the bottom displaying your key frames and etc. It's also lacking automatic interpolation between the keys so you can play test the animation without manually adding additional frames, this makes it much harder if you need an animation\nto stay within a certain number of frames. The app has an animation retargeting feature, but it could probably be rounded out a bit more to work more like Maya or Unreal. If possible, it would be helpful to make the app platform agnostic so it can work on both Windows and Mac. If thatâ€™s too much reworking, then maybe just a Mac version as well. This isnâ€™t an absolute necessity, I currently use the app with Wine, but an app that can work natively would be much better. \n\nI didnâ€™t set a budget because Iâ€™m not sure what something like this would cost, and I didnâ€™t want to discourage anyone from applying. If youâ€™re interested let me know what you think, and how much you think you could complete this for. \n\nThe source code and application is here: \n\nhttps://github.com/LaZar00/KimeraCS\n",

I think we need to extrapolate that based on the number of rows but I'm not sure, so I need your help to figure this out. I was having trouble because the dataset is too large to open it all at once in Excel.\n\nOnce you know the number rides coming *out* of each zone/neighborhood:\n\n1. Break the data down and put it into excel based on all the categories that they have already tagged the data with but do it by zone/neighborhood: \n\nRides by Hour of Day (All Days)\t\nRides  by Hour of Day (Weekdays Only)\t\nRides  by Hour of Day (Weekends Only)\t\nRides  by Day of Week\t\nRides  by Month (All Days)\t\nRides  by Month (Weekdays Only)\t\nRides  by Month (Weekends Only)\t\nRides  By Date By Hour Buckets (All Days)\n\n2.

The main things I think it's missing are a Gizmo to move and rotate joints in 3D space, animation splines to make adjustments to direction and speed, and a real animation bar at the bottom displaying your key frames and etc. It's also lacking automatic interpolation between the keys so you can play test the animation without manually adding additional frames, this makes it much harder if you need an animation\nto stay within a certain number of frames. The app has an animation retargeting feature, but it could probably be rounded out a bit more to work more like Maya or Unreal. If possible, it would be helpful to make the app platform agnostic so it can work on both Windows and Mac. If thatâ€™s too much reworking, then maybe just a Mac version as well. This isnâ€™t an absolute necessity, I currently use the app with Wine, but an app that can work natively would be much better. \n\nI didnâ€™t set a budget because Iâ€™m not sure what something like this would cost, and I didnâ€™t want to discourage anyone from applying. If youâ€™re interested let me know what you think, and how much you think you could complete this for. \n\nThe source code and application is here: \n\nhttps://github.com/LaZar00/KimeraCS\n",

        "description": "I would like someone to pull all the publicly available Uber data of the city of Miami from https://movement.uber.com/explore/miami/travel-times\n\nWith the data provided, is it possible (with this data) to figure out how many rides come from each zone/neighborhood of Miami? I think we need to extrapolate that based on the number of rows but I'm not sure, so I need your help to figure this out. I was having trouble because the dataset is too large to open it all at once in Excel.\n\nOnce you know the number rides coming *out* of each zone/neighborhood:\n\n1. Break the data down and put it into excel based on all the categories that they have already tagged the data with but do it by zone/neighborhood: \n\nRides by Hour of Day (All Days)\t\nRides  by Hour of Day (Weekdays Only)\t\nRides  by Hour of Day (Weekends Only)\t\nRides  by Day of Week\t\nRides  by Month (All Days)\t\nRides  by Month (Weekdays Only)\t\nRides  by Month (Weekends Only)\t\nRides  By Date By Hour Buckets (All Days)\n\n2. Create visuals for each each zone in a manner that you feel is the ideal way to present it. Open to suggestions here.\n\nThank you.",

        "description": "GluCare was born out of the idea that a combination of a human-centric patient approach and a technology working together will lead to a better and more efficient management of diabetes and metabolic syndrome. \n\nThe GluCare team is looking to expand their successful business model from physical interaction to service in the cloud. This new offering will be called Zone.Health. The ask is to build a website that acts as the hub of information in order to get patients to join their program. The various sections of the site will consist of: \n\nâ€¢\tâ—  What is Zone.health? \nâ€¢\tâ—  The program \nâ€¢\tâ—  Why it works? \nâ€¢\tâ—  Join now \nâ€¢\tâ—  Pricing \nâ€¢\tâ—  FAQs \n\nWe envisage the website to have an onboarding portal which will consist of three parts, an API, a CMS and a Frontend system.\n\n1.\tThis will allow for future integration into other customer touch points should the need arise. The onboarding journey will consist of: \n\n1) BMI calculator\n\nIf less 27, show a message to say that they donâ€™t qualify. If greater 27, take the user through the registration flow. \n\n2) Registration (numerous inputs)\n\nOnce the patient has provided the above, they will be visible within the custom built CMS. The practitioner will have a login to the CMS whereby they will be able to view the information captured by the patient. They would be able to add specific notes after the consultation and select the medication and the required gear (glucose monitor, wearable and scale) to send to the patient. The idea is that the cost of these items will be built into the system, so that the practitioner can simply select the products, which then creates the payment link. This will be centrally managed in its totality in the CMS. \nOnce the payment has been made, the kit will be delivered to the patient and the engagement with Zone.Health will be through the app. However, each month, the practitioner will log into the CMS and create a payment link based on the progress the patient is making. \n\nAll invoices and orders will be available to the patient when logging into the site. It is important to note that the onboarding portal and the mobile app (this has been developed separately and not in the scope of this project) should use the same authentication system in order to prevent the patient having to create two seperate accounts. \nDetails will be provided once engagement starts, but we expect the website to consist of:\n\no\tâ—  Project set up \no\tâ—  Information website build \no\tâ—  BMI \no\tâ—  Registration \no\tâ—  Further screening questions \no\tâ—  Laboratory Test Uploads \no\tâ—  Schedule a visit \no\tâ—  Confirmation \no\tâ—  Payment Process \no\tâ—  Account Settings \no\tâ—  CMS - View users \no\tâ—  CMS - Create payments \no\tâ—  CMS - Shipment of your ZoneHealth kit notification \no\tâ—  Email Templates Creation \no\tâ—  Email Provider Integration \no\tâ—  CRM Integration \no\tâ—  Scheduling System Integration \no\tâ—  Payment Provider Integration \nVideo Conferencing Integration \n\nThere are similar businesses in the US and we like this the most: https://joinfound.com\n\n",

I would like a freelancer to propose a price for this work.  \n\nAt the site users log in with a username and password that I provide. The project to which they are assigned opens and user then adds one or more comments. There are multiple projects and multiple users so that login credentials ensures that the user accesses the correct project. I have admin rights on the site to set up projects, set up users, assign users to projects and download data collected. I need to make clear that I am not a website administrator, nor do I have deep skills in the technology. While I am tech savvy in a number of areas, and I have managed many tech development projects through Upwork and the predecessor companies. The freelancer will need to communicate with me at my level of understanding. \n\nThe site has not been used much recently and the code is now out of date. Most parts of the site seem to work ok except when a user logs in, their project does not open. I need a freelancer to review the code and update the site (patches, fixes, etc.). I do not need a redesign or new functionality; I only need the code updated. I do have more detailed documentation that I can share with freelancers that are shortlisted. The freelancer who created the site did great work but they are not available at this time so I need a new freelancer who can do this work. \n\nI have accounts on Heroku and Vercel to support this site and the below is a brief summary of the documentation from the freelancer that created the project.\nLIBRARIES &amp; FRAMEWORKS ON THE FRONT END\nReact JS - React is an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components.\nNext JS â€“ Was used to build server-side rendering and static web applications using React.\nStyled-Components â€“ This utilizes tagged template literals to style the components.\nMaterial-UI - React components for faster and easier web development.\nJs-Cookie â€“ Is a simple, lightweight JavaScript API for handling browser cookies, this was used to read the cookie token stored in the browser and was used for authenticating users as soon as they are signed in using the form on the application.\nIsormorphic-Fetch - Isomorphic-fetch is implementation of fetch for both Node.js and browser, this was used to communicate with the backend (server) and used to fetch data stored on the server database and pulled to the frontend.\nThe rest of the libraries/frameworks can be found in the package.json file on the root directory of the project. Any developer that will be doing further work on the project can find the documentation on the README.MD file on the GitHub page useful and straightforward.\n\nLIBRARIES &amp; FRAMEWORKS ON THE BACK END\nNode JS â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side.\nExpress JS â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side.\nMongoose â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code \nJson2cvs â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side.\n\n\n \n",

        "description": "I have a 3D modding application for Final Fantasy VII, and itâ€™s missing critical animation tools. The main things I think it's missing are a Gizmo to move and rotate joints in 3D space, animation splines to make adjustments to direction and speed, and a real animation bar at the bottom displaying your key frames and etc. It's also lacking automatic interpolation between the keys so you can play test the animation without manually adding additional frames, this makes it much harder if you need an animation\nto stay within a certain number of frames. The app has an animation retargeting feature, but it could probably be rounded out a bit more to work more like Maya or Unreal. If possible, it would be helpful to make the app platform agnostic so it can work on both Windows and Mac. If thatâ€™s too much reworking, then maybe just a Mac version as well. This isnâ€™t an absolute necessity, I currently use the app with Wine, but an app that can work natively would be much better. \n\nI didnâ€™t set a budget because Iâ€™m not sure what something like this would cost, and I didnâ€™t want to discourage anyone from applying. If youâ€™re interested let me know what you think, and how much you think you could complete this for. \n\nThe source code and application is here: \n\nhttps://github.com/LaZar00/KimeraCS\n",

        "description": "I have a 3D modding application for Final Fantasy VII, and itâ€™s missing critical animation tools. The main things I think it's missing are a Gizmo to move and rotate joints in 3D space, animation splines to make adjustments to direction and speed, and a real animation bar at the bottom displaying your key frames and etc. It's also lacking automatic interpolation between the keys so you can play test the animation without manually adding additional frames, this makes it much harder if you need an animation\nto stay within a certain number of frames. The app has an animation retargeting feature, but it could probably be rounded out a bit more to work more like Maya or Unreal. If possible, it would be helpful to make the app platform agnostic so it can work on both Windows and Mac. If thatâ€™s too much reworking, then maybe just a Mac version as well. This isnâ€™t an absolute necessity, I currently use the app with Wine, but an app that can work natively would be much better. \n\nI didnâ€™t set a budget because Iâ€™m not sure what something like this would cost, and I didnâ€™t want to discourage anyone from applying. If youâ€™re interested let me know what you think, and how much you think you could complete this for. \n\nThe source code and application is here: \n\nhttps://github.com/LaZar00/KimeraCS\n",

The app has an animation retargeting feature, but it could probably be rounded out a bit more to work more like Maya or Unreal. If possible, it would be helpful to make the app platform agnostic so it can work on both Windows and Mac. If thatâ€™s too much reworking, then maybe just a Mac version as well.

        "description": "I have a 3D modding application for Final Fantasy VII, and itâ€™s missing critical animation tools. The main things I think it's missing are a Gizmo to move and rotate joints in 3D space, animation splines to make adjustments to direction and speed, and a real animation bar at the bottom displaying your key frames and etc. It's also lacking automatic interpolation between the keys so you can play test the animation without manually adding additional frames, this makes it much harder if you need an animation\nto stay within a certain number of frames. The app has an animation retargeting feature, but it could probably be rounded out a bit more to work more like Maya or Unreal. If possible, it would be helpful to make the app platform agnostic so it can work on both Windows and Mac. If thatâ€™s too much reworking, then maybe just a Mac version as well. This isnâ€™t an absolute necessity, I currently use the app with Wine, but an app that can work natively would be much better. \n\nI didnâ€™t set a budget because Iâ€™m not sure what something like this would cost, and I didnâ€™t want to discourage anyone from applying. If youâ€™re interested let me know what you think, and how much you think you could complete this for. \n\nThe source code and application is here: \n\nhttps://github.com/LaZar00/KimeraCS\n",

        "description": "GluCare was born out of the idea that a combination of a human-centric patient approach and a technology working together will lead to a better and more efficient management of diabetes and metabolic syndrome. \n\nThe GluCare team is looking to expand their successful business model from physical interaction to service in the cloud. This new offering will be called Zone.Health. The ask is to build a website that acts as the hub of information in order to get patients to join their program. The various sections of the site will consist of: \n\nâ€¢\tâ—  What is Zone.health? \nâ€¢\tâ—  The program \nâ€¢\tâ—  Why it works? \nâ€¢\tâ—  Join now \nâ€¢\tâ—  Pricing \nâ€¢\tâ—  FAQs \n\nWe envisage the website to have an onboarding portal which will consist of three parts, an API, a CMS and a Frontend system.\n\n1.\tThis will allow for future integration into other customer touch points should the need arise. The onboarding journey will consist of: \n\n1) BMI calculator\n\nIf less 27, show a message to say that they donâ€™t qualify. If greater 27, take the user through the registration flow. \n\n2) Registration (numerous inputs)\n\nOnce the patient has provided the above, they will be visible within the custom built CMS. The practitioner will have a login to the CMS whereby they will be able to view the information captured by the patient. They would be able to add specific notes after the consultation and select the medication and the required gear (glucose monitor, wearable and scale) to send to the patient. The idea is that the cost of these items will be built into the system, so that the practitioner can simply select the products, which then creates the payment link. This will be centrally managed in its totality in the CMS. \nOnce the payment has been made, the kit will be delivered to the patient and the engagement with Zone.Health will be through the app. However, each month, the practitioner will log into the CMS and create a payment link based on the progress the patient is making. \n\nAll invoices and orders will be available to the patient when logging into the site. It is important to note that the onboarding portal and the mobile app (this has been developed separately and not in the scope of this project) should use the same authentication system in order to prevent the patient having to create two seperate accounts. \nDetails will be provided once engagement starts, but we expect the website to consist of:\n\no\tâ—  Project set up \no\tâ—  Information website build \no\tâ—  BMI \no\tâ—  Registration \no\tâ—  Further screening questions \no\tâ—  Laboratory Test Uploads \no\tâ—  Schedule a visit \no\tâ—  Confirmation \no\tâ—  Payment Process \no\tâ—  Account Settings \no\tâ—  CMS - View users \no\tâ—  CMS - Create payments \no\tâ—  CMS - Shipment of your ZoneHealth kit notification \no\tâ—  Email Templates Creation \no\tâ—  Email Provider Integration \no\tâ—  CRM Integration \no\tâ—  Scheduling System Integration \no\tâ—  Payment Provider Integration \nVideo Conferencing Integration \n\nThere are similar businesses in the US and we like this the most: https://joinfound.com\n\n",

        "description": "GluCare was born out of the idea that a combination of a human-centric patient approach and a technology working together will lead to a better and more efficient management of diabetes and metabolic syndrome. \n\nThe GluCare team is looking to expand their successful business model from physical interaction to service in the cloud. This new offering will be called Zone.Health. The ask is to build a website that acts as the hub of information in order to get patients to join their program. The various sections of the site will consist of: \n\nâ€¢\tâ—  What is Zone.health? \nâ€¢\tâ—  The program \nâ€¢\tâ—  Why it works? \nâ€¢\tâ—  Join now \nâ€¢\tâ—  Pricing \nâ€¢\tâ—  FAQs \n\nWe envisage the website to have an onboarding portal which will consist of three parts, an API, a CMS and a Frontend system.\n\n1.\tThis will allow for future integration into other customer touch points should the need arise. The onboarding journey will consist of: \n\n1) BMI calculator\n\nIf less 27, show a message to say that they donâ€™t qualify. If greater 27, take the user through the registration flow. \n\n2) Registration (numerous inputs)\n\nOnce the patient has provided the above, they will be visible within the custom built CMS. The practitioner will have a login to the CMS whereby they will be able to view the information captured by the patient. They would be able to add specific notes after the consultation and select the medication and the required gear (glucose monitor, wearable and scale) to send to the patient. The idea is that the cost of these items will be built into the system, so that the practitioner can simply select the products, which then creates the payment link. This will be centrally managed in its totality in the CMS. \nOnce the payment has been made, the kit will be delivered to the patient and the engagement with Zone.Health will be through the app. However, each month, the practitioner will log into the CMS and create a payment link based on the progress the patient is making. \n\nAll invoices and orders will be available to the patient when logging into the site. It is important to note that the onboarding portal and the mobile app (this has been developed separately and not in the scope of this project) should use the same authentication system in order to prevent the patient having to create two seperate accounts. \nDetails will be provided once engagement starts, but we expect the website to consist of:\n\no\tâ—  Project set up \no\tâ—  Information website build \no\tâ—  BMI \no\tâ—  Registration \no\tâ—  Further screening questions \no\tâ—  Laboratory Test Uploads \no\tâ—  Schedule a visit \no\tâ—  Confirmation \no\tâ—  Payment Process \no\tâ—  Account Settings \no\tâ—  CMS - View users \no\tâ—  CMS - Create payments \no\tâ—  CMS - Shipment of your ZoneHealth kit notification \no\tâ—  Email Templates Creation \no\tâ—  Email Provider Integration \no\tâ—  CRM Integration \no\tâ—  Scheduling System Integration \no\tâ—  Payment Provider Integration \nVideo Conferencing Integration \n\nThere are similar businesses in the US and we like this the most: https://joinfound.com\n\n",

I would like a freelancer to propose a price for this work.  \n\nAt the site users log in with a username and password that I provide. The project to which they are assigned opens and user then adds one or more comments. There are multiple projects and multiple users so that login credentials ensures that the user accesses the correct project. I have admin rights on the site to set up projects, set up users, assign users to projects and download data collected. I need to make clear that I am not a website administrator, nor do I have deep skills in the technology. While I am tech savvy in a number of areas, and I have managed many tech development projects through Upwork and the predecessor companies. The freelancer will need to communicate with me at my level of understanding. \n\nThe site has not been used much recently and the code is now out of date. Most parts of the site seem to work ok except when a user logs in, their project does not open. I need a freelancer to review the code and update the site (patches, fixes, etc.). I do not need a redesign or new functionality; I only need the code updated. I do have more detailed documentation that I can share with freelancers that are shortlisted. The freelancer who created the site did great work but they are not available at this time so I need a new freelancer who can do this work. \n\nI have accounts on Heroku and Vercel to support this site and the below is a brief summary of the documentation from the freelancer that created the project.\nLIBRARIES &amp; FRAMEWORKS ON THE FRONT END\nReact JS - React is an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components.\nNext JS â€“ Was used to build server-side rendering and static web applications using React.\nStyled-Components â€“ This utilizes tagged template literals to style the components.\nMaterial-UI - React components for faster and easier web development.\nJs-Cookie â€“ Is a simple, lightweight JavaScript API for handling browser cookies, this was used to read the cookie token stored in the browser and was used for authenticating users as soon as they are signed in using the form on the application.\nIsormorphic-Fetch - Isomorphic-fetch is implementation of fetch for both Node.js and browser, this was used to communicate with the backend (server) and used to fetch data stored on the server database and pulled to the frontend.\nThe rest of the libraries/frameworks can be found in the package.json file on the root directory of the project. Any developer that will be doing further work on the project can find the documentation on the README.MD file on the GitHub page useful and straightforward.\n\nLIBRARIES &amp; FRAMEWORKS ON THE BACK END\nNode JS â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side.\nExpress JS â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side.\nMongoose â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code \nJson2cvs â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side.\n\n\n \n",

        "description": "I would like someone to pull all the publicly available Uber data of the city of Miami from https://movement.uber.com/explore/miami/travel-times\n\nWith the data provided, is it possible (with this data) to figure out how many rides come from each zone/neighborhood of Miami? I think we need to extrapolate that based on the number of rows but I'm not sure, so I need your help to figure this out. I was having trouble because the dataset is too large to open it all at once in Excel.\n\nOnce you know the number rides coming *out* of each zone/neighborhood:\n\n1. Break the data down and put it into excel based on all the categories that they have already tagged the data with but do it by zone/neighborhood: \n\nRides by Hour of Day (All Days)\t\nRides  by Hour of Day (Weekdays Only)\t\nRides  by Hour of Day (Weekends Only)\t\nRides  by Day of Week\t\nRides  by Month (All Days)\t\nRides  by Month (Weekdays Only)\t\nRides  by Month (Weekends Only)\t\nRides  By Date By Hour Buckets (All Days)\n\n2.

        "description": "GluCare was born out of the idea that a combination of a human-centric patient approach and a technology working together will lead to a better and more efficient management of diabetes and metabolic syndrome. \n\nThe GluCare team is looking to expand their successful business model from physical interaction to service in the cloud. This new offering will be called Zone.Health. The ask is to build a website that acts as the hub of information in order to get patients to join their program. The various sections of the site will consist of: \n\nâ€¢\tâ—  What is Zone.health? \nâ€¢\tâ—  The program \nâ€¢\tâ—  Why it works? \nâ€¢\tâ—  Join now \nâ€¢\tâ—  Pricing \nâ€¢\tâ—  FAQs \n\nWe envisage the website to have an onboarding portal which will consist of three parts, an API, a CMS and a Frontend system.\n\n1.\tThis will allow for future integration into other customer touch points should the need arise. The onboarding journey will consist of: \n\n1) BMI calculator\n\nIf less 27, show a message to say that they donâ€™t qualify. If greater 27, take the user through the registration flow. \n\n2) Registration (numerous inputs)\n\nOnce the patient has provided the above, they will be visible within the custom built CMS. The practitioner will have a login to the CMS whereby they will be able to view the information captured by the patient. They would be able to add specific notes after the consultation and select the medication and the required gear (glucose monitor, wearable and scale) to send to the patient. The idea is that the cost of these items will be built into the system, so that the practitioner can simply select the products, which then creates the payment link. This will be centrally managed in its totality in the CMS. \nOnce the payment has been made, the kit will be delivered to the patient and the engagement with Zone.Health will be through the app. However, each month, the practitioner will log into the CMS and create a payment link based on the progress the patient is making. \n\nAll invoices and orders will be available to the patient when logging into the site. It is important to note that the onboarding portal and the mobile app (this has been developed separately and not in the scope of this project) should use the same authentication system in order to prevent the patient having to create two seperate accounts. \nDetails will be provided once engagement starts, but we expect the website to consist of:\n\no\tâ—  Project set up \no\tâ—  Information website build \no\tâ—  BMI \no\tâ—  Registration \no\tâ—  Further screening questions \no\tâ—  Laboratory Test Uploads \no\tâ—  Schedule a visit \no\tâ—  Confirmation \no\tâ—  Payment Process \no\tâ—  Account Settings \no\tâ—  CMS - View users \no\tâ—  CMS - Create payments \no\tâ—  CMS - Shipment of your ZoneHealth kit notification \no\tâ—  Email Templates Creation \no\tâ—  Email Provider Integration \no\tâ—  CRM Integration \no\tâ—  Scheduling System Integration \no\tâ—  Payment Provider Integration \nVideo Conferencing Integration \n\nThere are similar businesses in the US and we like this the most: https://joinfound.com\n\n",

        "description": "I have an interactive website that needs to be updated. The purpose of the site is to collect comments from users who are directed to the site. I would like a freelancer to propose a price for this work.  \n\nAt the site users log in with a username and password that I provide. The project to which they are assigned opens and user then adds one or more comments. There are multiple projects and multiple users so that login credentials ensures that the user accesses the correct project. I have admin rights on the site to set up projects, set up users, assign users to projects and download data collected. I need to make clear that I am not a website administrator, nor do I have deep skills in the technology. While I am tech savvy in a number of areas, and I have managed many tech development projects through Upwork and the predecessor companies. The freelancer will need to communicate with me at my level of understanding. \n\nThe site has not been used much recently and the code is now out of date. Most parts of the site seem to work ok except when a user logs in, their project does not open. I need a freelancer to review the code and update the site (patches, fixes, etc.). I do not need a redesign or new functionality; I only need the code updated. I do have more detailed documentation that I can share with freelancers that are shortlisted. The freelancer who created the site did great work but they are not available at this time so I need a new freelancer who can do this work. \n\nI have accounts on Heroku and Vercel to support this site and the below is a brief summary of the documentation from the freelancer that created the project.\nLIBRARIES &amp; FRAMEWORKS ON THE FRONT END\nReact JS - React is an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components.\nNext JS â€“ Was used to build server-side rendering and static web applications using React.\nStyled-Components â€“ This utilizes tagged template literals to style the components.\nMaterial-UI - React components for faster and easier web development.\nJs-Cookie â€“ Is a simple, lightweight JavaScript API for handling browser cookies, this was used to read the cookie token stored in the browser and was used for authenticating users as soon as they are signed in using the form on the application.\nIsormorphic-Fetch - Isomorphic-fetch is implementation of fetch for both Node.js and browser, this was used to communicate with the backend (server) and used to fetch data stored on the server database and pulled to the frontend.\nThe rest of the libraries/frameworks can be found in the package.json file on the root directory of the project.

        "description": "GluCare was born out of the idea that a combination of a human-centric patient approach and a technology working together will lead to a better and more efficient management of diabetes and metabolic syndrome. \n\nThe GluCare team is looking to expand their successful business model from physical interaction to service in the cloud. This new offering will be called Zone.Health. The ask is to build a website that acts as the hub of information in order to get patients to join their program. The various sections of the site will consist of: \n\nâ€¢\tâ—  What is Zone.health? \nâ€¢\tâ—  The program \nâ€¢\tâ—  Why it works? \nâ€¢\tâ—  Join now \nâ€¢\tâ—  Pricing \nâ€¢\tâ—  FAQs \n\nWe envisage the website to have an onboarding portal which will consist of three parts, an API, a CMS and a Frontend system.\n\n1.\tThis will allow for future integration into other customer touch points should the need arise. The onboarding journey will consist of: \n\n1) BMI calculator\n\nIf less 27, show a message to say that they donâ€™t qualify. If greater 27, take the user through the registration flow. \n\n2) Registration (numerous inputs)\n\nOnce the patient has provided the above, they will be visible within the custom built CMS. The practitioner will have a login to the CMS whereby they will be able to view the information captured by the patient. They would be able to add specific notes after the consultation and select the medication and the required gear (glucose monitor, wearable and scale) to send to the patient. The idea is that the cost of these items will be built into the system, so that the practitioner can simply select the products, which then creates the payment link. This will be centrally managed in its totality in the CMS. \nOnce the payment has been made, the kit will be delivered to the patient and the engagement with Zone.Health will be through the app. However, each month, the practitioner will log into the CMS and create a payment link based on the progress the patient is making. \n\nAll invoices and orders will be available to the patient when logging into the site. It is important to note that the onboarding portal and the mobile app (this has been developed separately and not in the scope of this project) should use the same authentication system in order to prevent the patient having to create two seperate accounts. \nDetails will be provided once engagement starts, but we expect the website to consist of:\n\no\tâ—  Project set up \no\tâ—  Information website build \no\tâ—  BMI \no\tâ—  Registration \no\tâ—  Further screening questions \no\tâ—  Laboratory Test Uploads \no\tâ—  Schedule a visit \no\tâ—  Confirmation \no\tâ—  Payment Process \no\tâ—  Account Settings \no\tâ—  CMS - View users \no\tâ—  CMS - Create payments \no\tâ—  CMS - Shipment of your ZoneHealth kit notification \no\tâ—  Email Templates Creation \no\tâ—  Email Provider Integration \no\tâ—  CRM Integration \no\tâ—  Scheduling System Integration \no\tâ—  Payment Provider Integration \nVideo Conferencing Integration \n\nThere are similar businesses in the US and we like this the most: https://joinfound.com\n\n",

        "description": "I have a 3D modding application for Final Fantasy VII, and itâ€™s missing critical animation tools. The main things I think it's missing are a Gizmo to move and rotate joints in 3D space, animation splines to make adjustments to direction and speed, and a real animation bar at the bottom displaying your key frames and etc. It's also lacking automatic interpolation between the keys so you can play test the animation without manually adding additional frames, this makes it much harder if you need an animation\nto stay within a certain number of frames. The app has an animation retargeting feature, but it could probably be rounded out a bit more to work more like Maya or Unreal. If possible, it would be helpful to make the app platform agnostic so it can work on both Windows and Mac. If thatâ€™s too much reworking, then maybe just a Mac version as well. This isnâ€™t an absolute necessity, I currently use the app with Wine, but an app that can work natively would be much better. \n\nI didnâ€™t set a budget because Iâ€™m not sure what something like this would cost, and I didnâ€™t want to discourage anyone from applying. If youâ€™re interested let me know what you think, and how much you think you could complete this for. \n\nThe source code and application is here: \n\nhttps://github.com/LaZar00/KimeraCS\n",

        "description": "GluCare was born out of the idea that a combination of a human-centric patient approach and a technology working together will lead to a better and more efficient management of diabetes and metabolic syndrome. \n\nThe GluCare team is looking to expand their successful business model from physical interaction to service in the cloud. This new offering will be called Zone.Health. The ask is to build a website that acts as the hub of information in order to get patients to join their program. The various sections of the site will consist of: \n\nâ€¢\tâ—  What is Zone.health? \nâ€¢\tâ—  The program \nâ€¢\tâ—  Why it works? \nâ€¢\tâ—  Join now \nâ€¢\tâ—  Pricing \nâ€¢\tâ—  FAQs \n\nWe envisage the website to have an onboarding portal which will consist of three parts, an API, a CMS and a Frontend system.\n\n1.\tThis will allow for future integration into other customer touch points should the need arise. The onboarding journey will consist of: \n\n1) BMI calculator\n\nIf less 27, show a message to say that they donâ€™t qualify. If greater 27, take the user through the registration flow. \n\n2) Registration (numerous inputs)\n\nOnce the patient has provided the above, they will be visible within the custom built CMS. The practitioner will have a login to the CMS whereby they will be able to view the information captured by the patient. They would be able to add specific notes after the consultation and select the medication and the required gear (glucose monitor, wearable and scale) to send to the patient. The idea is that the cost of these items will be built into the system, so that the practitioner can simply select the products, which then creates the payment link. This will be centrally managed in its totality in the CMS. \nOnce the payment has been made, the kit will be delivered to the patient and the engagement with Zone.Health will be through the app. However, each month, the practitioner will log into the CMS and create a payment link based on the progress the patient is making. \n\nAll invoices and orders will be available to the patient when logging into the site. It is important to note that the onboarding portal and the mobile app (this has been developed separately and not in the scope of this project) should use the same authentication system in order to prevent the patient having to create two seperate accounts. \nDetails will be provided once engagement starts, but we expect the website to consist of:\n\no\tâ—  Project set up \no\tâ—  Information website build \no\tâ—  BMI \no\tâ—  Registration \no\tâ—  Further screening questions \no\tâ—  Laboratory Test Uploads \no\tâ—  Schedule a visit \no\tâ—  Confirmation \no\tâ—  Payment Process \no\tâ—  Account Settings \no\tâ—  CMS - View users \no\tâ—  CMS - Create payments \no\tâ—  CMS - Shipment of your ZoneHealth kit notification \no\tâ—  Email Templates Creation \no\tâ—  Email Provider Integration \no\tâ—  CRM Integration \no\tâ—  Scheduling System Integration \no\tâ—  Payment Provider Integration \nVideo Conferencing Integration \n\nThere are similar businesses in the US and we like this the most: https://joinfound.com\n\n",

        "description": "GluCare was born out of the idea that a combination of a human-centric patient approach and a technology working together will lead to a better and more efficient management of diabetes and metabolic syndrome. \n\nThe GluCare team is looking to expand their successful business model from physical interaction to service in the cloud. This new offering will be called Zone.Health. The ask is to build a website that acts as the hub of information in order to get patients to join their program. The various sections of the site will consist of: \n\nâ€¢\tâ—  What is Zone.health? \nâ€¢\tâ—  The program \nâ€¢\tâ—  Why it works? \nâ€¢\tâ—  Join now \nâ€¢\tâ—  Pricing \nâ€¢\tâ—  FAQs \n\nWe envisage the website to have an onboarding portal which will consist of three parts, an API, a CMS and a Frontend system.\n\n1.\tThis will allow for future integration into other customer touch points should the need arise. The onboarding journey will consist of: \n\n1) BMI calculator\n\nIf less 27, show a message to say that they donâ€™t qualify. If greater 27, take the user through the registration flow. \n\n2) Registration (numerous inputs)\n\nOnce the patient has provided the above, they will be visible within the custom built CMS. The practitioner will have a login to the CMS whereby they will be able to view the information captured by the patient. They would be able to add specific notes after the consultation and select the medication and the required gear (glucose monitor, wearable and scale) to send to the patient. The idea is that the cost of these items will be built into the system, so that the practitioner can simply select the products, which then creates the payment link. This will be centrally managed in its totality in the CMS. \nOnce the payment has been made, the kit will be delivered to the patient and the engagement with Zone.Health will be through the app. However, each month, the practitioner will log into the CMS and create a payment link based on the progress the patient is making. \n\nAll invoices and orders will be available to the patient when logging into the site. It is important to note that the onboarding portal and the mobile app (this has been developed separately and not in the scope of this project) should use the same authentication system in order to prevent the patient having to create two seperate accounts. \nDetails will be provided once engagement starts, but we expect the website to consist of:\n\no\tâ—  Project set up \no\tâ—  Information website build \no\tâ—  BMI \no\tâ—  Registration \no\tâ—  Further screening questions \no\tâ—  Laboratory Test Uploads \no\tâ—  Schedule a visit \no\tâ—  Confirmation \no\tâ—  Payment Process \no\tâ—  Account Settings \no\tâ—  CMS - View users \no\tâ—  CMS - Create payments \no\tâ—  CMS - Shipment of your ZoneHealth kit notification \no\tâ—  Email Templates Creation \no\tâ—  Email Provider Integration \no\tâ—  CRM Integration \no\tâ—  Scheduling System Integration \no\tâ—  Payment Provider Integration \nVideo Conferencing Integration \n\nThere are similar businesses in the US and we like this the most: https://joinfound.com\n\n",

The freelancer who created the site did great work but they are not available at this time so I need a new freelancer who can do this work. \n\nI have accounts on Heroku and Vercel to support this site and the below is a brief summary of the documentation from the freelancer that created the project.\nLIBRARIES &amp; FRAMEWORKS ON THE FRONT END\nReact JS - React is an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components.\nNext JS â€“ Was used to build server-side rendering and static web applications using React.\nStyled-Components â€“ This utilizes tagged template literals to style the components.\nMaterial-UI - React components for faster and easier web development.\nJs-Cookie â€“ Is a simple, lightweight JavaScript API for handling browser cookies, this was used to read the cookie token stored in the browser and was used for authenticating users as soon as they are signed in using the form on the application.\nIsormorphic-Fetch - Isomorphic-fetch is implementation of fetch for both Node.js and browser, this was used to communicate with the backend (server) and used to fetch data stored on the server database and pulled to the frontend.\nThe rest of the libraries/frameworks can be found in the package.json file on the root directory of the project. Any developer that will be doing further work on the project can find the documentation on the README.MD file on the GitHub page useful and straightforward.\n\nLIBRARIES &amp; FRAMEWORKS ON THE BACK END\nNode JS â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side.\nExpress JS â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side.\nMongoose â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code \nJson2cvs â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side.\n\n\n \n",

That is all, it's not a big project.\n\nSEO knowledge is important, not because we'll try to push high on organic ranking but at least because we want to do something that does not go against the ranking algorithm.\n\nIf you have made any projects for mobile application landing pages, please do share. We'll look at each of them and it will have a big impact on our decision.\n\nThat's pretty much it, if I'm missing anything please ask. I'll respond as fast as I can.",

        "description": "I have a 3D modding application for Final Fantasy VII, and itâ€™s missing critical animation tools. The main things I think it's missing are a Gizmo to move and rotate joints in 3D space, animation splines to make adjustments to direction and speed, and a real animation bar at the bottom displaying your key frames and etc. It's also lacking automatic interpolation between the keys so you can play test the animation without manually adding additional frames, this makes it much harder if you need an animation\nto stay within a certain number of frames. The app has an animation retargeting feature, but it could probably be rounded out a bit more to work more like Maya or Unreal. If possible, it would be helpful to make the app platform agnostic so it can work on both Windows and Mac. If thatâ€™s too much reworking, then maybe just a Mac version as well. This isnâ€™t an absolute necessity, I currently use the app with Wine, but an app that can work natively would be much better. \n\nI didnâ€™t set a budget because Iâ€™m not sure what something like this would cost, and I didnâ€™t want to discourage anyone from applying. If youâ€™re interested let me know what you think, and how much you think you could complete this for. \n\nThe source code and application is here: \n\nhttps://github.com/LaZar00/KimeraCS\n",

        "description": "GluCare was born out of the idea that a combination of a human-centric patient approach and a technology working together will lead to a better and more efficient management of diabetes and metabolic syndrome. \n\nThe GluCare team is looking to expand their successful business model from physical interaction to service in the cloud. This new offering will be called Zone.Health. The ask is to build a website that acts as the hub of information in order to get patients to join their program. The various sections of the site will consist of: \n\nâ€¢\tâ—  What is Zone.health? \nâ€¢\tâ—  The program \nâ€¢\tâ—  Why it works? \nâ€¢\tâ—  Join now \nâ€¢\tâ—  Pricing \nâ€¢\tâ—  FAQs \n\nWe envisage the website to have an onboarding portal which will consist of three parts, an API, a CMS and a Frontend system.\n\n1.\tThis will allow for future integration into other customer touch points should the need arise. The onboarding journey will consist of: \n\n1) BMI calculator\n\nIf less 27, show a message to say that they donâ€™t qualify. If greater 27, take the user through the registration flow. \n\n2) Registration (numerous inputs)\n\nOnce the patient has provided the above, they will be visible within the custom built CMS. The practitioner will have a login to the CMS whereby they will be able to view the information captured by the patient. They would be able to add specific notes after the consultation and select the medication and the required gear (glucose monitor, wearable and scale) to send to the patient. The idea is that the cost of these items will be built into the system, so that the practitioner can simply select the products, which then creates the payment link. This will be centrally managed in its totality in the CMS. \nOnce the payment has been made, the kit will be delivered to the patient and the engagement with Zone.Health will be through the app. However, each month, the practitioner will log into the CMS and create a payment link based on the progress the patient is making. \n\nAll invoices and orders will be available to the patient when logging into the site. It is important to note that the onboarding portal and the mobile app (this has been developed separately and not in the scope of this project) should use the same authentication system in order to prevent the patient having to create two seperate accounts. \nDetails will be provided once engagement starts, but we expect the website to consist of:\n\no\tâ—  Project set up \no\tâ—  Information website build \no\tâ—  BMI \no\tâ—  Registration \no\tâ—  Further screening questions \no\tâ—  Laboratory Test Uploads \no\tâ—  Schedule a visit \no\tâ—  Confirmation \no\tâ—  Payment Process \no\tâ—  Account Settings \no\tâ—  CMS - View users \no\tâ—  CMS - Create payments \no\tâ—  CMS - Shipment of your ZoneHealth kit notification \no\tâ—  Email Templates Creation \no\tâ—  Email Provider Integration \no\tâ—  CRM Integration \no\tâ—  Scheduling System Integration \no\tâ—  Payment Provider Integration \nVideo Conferencing Integration \n\nThere are similar businesses in the US and we like this the most: https://joinfound.com\n\n",

        "description": "I have a 3D modding application for Final Fantasy VII, and itâ€™s missing critical animation tools. The main things I think it's missing are a Gizmo to move and rotate joints in 3D space, animation splines to make adjustments to direction and speed, and a real animation bar at the bottom displaying your key frames and etc. It's also lacking automatic interpolation between the keys so you can play test the animation without manually adding additional frames, this makes it much harder if you need an animation\nto stay within a certain number of frames. The app has an animation retargeting feature, but it could probably be rounded out a bit more to work more like Maya or Unreal. If possible, it would be helpful to make the app platform agnostic so it can work on both Windows and Mac. If thatâ€™s too much reworking, then maybe just a Mac version as well. This isnâ€™t an absolute necessity, I currently use the app with Wine, but an app that can work natively would be much better. \n\nI didnâ€™t set a budget because Iâ€™m not sure what something like this would cost, and I didnâ€™t want to discourage anyone from applying.

I would like a freelancer to propose a price for this work.  \n\nAt the site users log in with a username and password that I provide. The project to which they are assigned opens and user then adds one or more comments. There are multiple projects and multiple users so that login credentials ensures that the user accesses the correct project. I have admin rights on the site to set up projects, set up users, assign users to projects and download data collected. I need to make clear that I am not a website administrator, nor do I have deep skills in the technology. While I am tech savvy in a number of areas, and I have managed many tech development projects through Upwork and the predecessor companies. The freelancer will need to communicate with me at my level of understanding. \n\nThe site has not been used much recently and the code is now out of date. Most parts of the site seem to work ok except when a user logs in, their project does not open. I need a freelancer to review the code and update the site (patches, fixes, etc.). I do not need a redesign or new functionality; I only need the code updated. I do have more detailed documentation that I can share with freelancers that are shortlisted. The freelancer who created the site did great work but they are not available at this time so I need a new freelancer who can do this work. \n\nI have accounts on Heroku and Vercel to support this site and the below is a brief summary of the documentation from the freelancer that created the project.\nLIBRARIES &amp; FRAMEWORKS ON THE FRONT END\nReact JS - React is an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components.\nNext JS â€“ Was used to build server-side rendering and static web applications using React.\nStyled-Components â€“ This utilizes tagged template literals to style the components.\nMaterial-UI - React components for faster and easier web development.\nJs-Cookie â€“ Is a simple, lightweight JavaScript API for handling browser cookies, this was used to read the cookie token stored in the browser and was used for authenticating users as soon as they are signed in using the form on the application.\nIsormorphic-Fetch - Isomorphic-fetch is implementation of fetch for both Node.js and browser, this was used to communicate with the backend (server) and used to fetch data stored on the server database and pulled to the frontend.\nThe rest of the libraries/frameworks can be found in the package.json file on the root directory of the project.

        "description": "I have a 3D modding application for Final Fantasy VII, and itâ€™s missing critical animation tools. The main things I think it's missing are a Gizmo to move and rotate joints in 3D space, animation splines to make adjustments to direction and speed, and a real animation bar at the bottom displaying your key frames and etc. It's also lacking automatic interpolation between the keys so you can play test the animation without manually adding additional frames, this makes it much harder if you need an animation\nto stay within a certain number of frames. The app has an animation retargeting feature, but it could probably be rounded out a bit more to work more like Maya or Unreal. If possible, it would be helpful to make the app platform agnostic so it can work on both Windows and Mac. If thatâ€™s too much reworking, then maybe just a Mac version as well. This isnâ€™t an absolute necessity, I currently use the app with Wine, but an app that can work natively would be much better. \n\nI didnâ€™t set a budget because Iâ€™m not sure what something like this would cost, and I didnâ€™t want to discourage anyone from applying. If youâ€™re interested let me know what you think, and how much you think you could complete this for. \n\nThe source code and application is here: \n\nhttps://github.com/LaZar00/KimeraCS\n",

        "description": "GluCare was born out of the idea that a combination of a human-centric patient approach and a technology working together will lead to a better and more efficient management of diabetes and metabolic syndrome. \n\nThe GluCare team is looking to expand their successful business model from physical interaction to service in the cloud. This new offering will be called Zone.Health. The ask is to build a website that acts as the hub of information in order to get patients to join their program. The various sections of the site will consist of: \n\nâ€¢\tâ—  What is Zone.health? \nâ€¢\tâ—  The program \nâ€¢\tâ—  Why it works? \nâ€¢\tâ—  Join now \nâ€¢\tâ—  Pricing \nâ€¢\tâ—  FAQs \n\nWe envisage the website to have an onboarding portal which will consist of three parts, an API, a CMS and a Frontend system.\n\n1.\tThis will allow for future integration into other customer touch points should the need arise. The onboarding journey will consist of: \n\n1) BMI calculator\n\nIf less 27, show a message to say that they donâ€™t qualify. If greater 27, take the user through the registration flow. \n\n2) Registration (numerous inputs)\n\nOnce the patient has provided the above, they will be visible within the custom built CMS. The practitioner will have a login to the CMS whereby they will be able to view the information captured by the patient. They would be able to add specific notes after the consultation and select the medication and the required gear (glucose monitor, wearable and scale) to send to the patient. The idea is that the cost of these items will be built into the system, so that the practitioner can simply select the products, which then creates the payment link. This will be centrally managed in its totality in the CMS. \nOnce the payment has been made, the kit will be delivered to the patient and the engagement with Zone.Health will be through the app. However, each month, the practitioner will log into the CMS and create a payment link based on the progress the patient is making. \n\nAll invoices and orders will be available to the patient when logging into the site. It is important to note that the onboarding portal and the mobile app (this has been developed separately and not in the scope of this project) should use the same authentication system in order to prevent the patient having to create two seperate accounts. \nDetails will be provided once engagement starts, but we expect the website to consist of:\n\no\tâ—  Project set up \no\tâ—  Information website build \no\tâ—  BMI \no\tâ—  Registration \no\tâ—  Further screening questions \no\tâ—  Laboratory Test Uploads \no\tâ—  Schedule a visit \no\tâ—  Confirmation \no\tâ—  Payment Process \no\tâ—  Account Settings \no\tâ—  CMS - View users \no\tâ—  CMS - Create payments \no\tâ—  CMS - Shipment of your ZoneHealth kit notification \no\tâ—  Email Templates Creation \no\tâ—  Email Provider Integration \no\tâ—  CRM Integration \no\tâ—  Scheduling System Integration \no\tâ—  Payment Provider Integration \nVideo Conferencing Integration \n\nThere are similar businesses in the US and we like this the most: https://joinfound.com\n\n",

        "description": "GluCare was born out of the idea that a combination of a human-centric patient approach and a technology working together will lead to a better and more efficient management of diabetes and metabolic syndrome. \n\nThe GluCare team is looking to expand their successful business model from physical interaction to service in the cloud. This new offering will be called Zone.Health. The ask is to build a website that acts as the hub of information in order to get patients to join their program. The various sections of the site will consist of: \n\nâ€¢\tâ—  What is Zone.health? \nâ€¢\tâ—  The program \nâ€¢\tâ—  Why it works? \nâ€¢\tâ—  Join now \nâ€¢\tâ—  Pricing \nâ€¢\tâ—  FAQs \n\nWe envisage the website to have an onboarding portal which will consist of three parts, an API, a CMS and a Frontend system.\n\n1.\tThis will allow for future integration into other customer touch points should the need arise. The onboarding journey will consist of: \n\n1) BMI calculator\n\nIf less 27, show a message to say that they donâ€™t qualify. If greater 27, take the user through the registration flow. \n\n2) Registration (numerous inputs)\n\nOnce the patient has provided the above, they will be visible within the custom built CMS. The practitioner will have a login to the CMS whereby they will be able to view the information captured by the patient. They would be able to add specific notes after the consultation and select the medication and the required gear (glucose monitor, wearable and scale) to send to the patient. The idea is that the cost of these items will be built into the system, so that the practitioner can simply select the products, which then creates the payment link. This will be centrally managed in its totality in the CMS. \nOnce the payment has been made, the kit will be delivered to the patient and the engagement with Zone.Health will be through the app. However, each month, the practitioner will log into the CMS and create a payment link based on the progress the patient is making. \n\nAll invoices and orders will be available to the patient when logging into the site. It is important to note that the onboarding portal and the mobile app (this has been developed separately and not in the scope of this project) should use the same authentication system in order to prevent the patient having to create two seperate accounts. \nDetails will be provided once engagement starts, but we expect the website to consist of:\n\no\tâ—  Project set up \no\tâ—  Information website build \no\tâ—  BMI \no\tâ—  Registration \no\tâ—  Further screening questions \no\tâ—  Laboratory Test Uploads \no\tâ—  Schedule a visit \no\tâ—  Confirmation \no\tâ—  Payment Process \no\tâ—  Account Settings \no\tâ—  CMS - View users \no\tâ—  CMS - Create payments \no\tâ—  CMS - Shipment of your ZoneHealth kit notification \no\tâ—  Email Templates Creation \no\tâ—  Email Provider Integration \no\tâ—  CRM Integration \no\tâ—  Scheduling System Integration \no\tâ—  Payment Provider Integration \nVideo Conferencing Integration \n\nThere are similar businesses in the US and we like this the most: https://joinfound.com\n\n",

        "description": "I have a 3D modding application for Final Fantasy VII, and itâ€™s missing critical animation tools. The main things I think it's missing are a Gizmo to move and rotate joints in 3D space, animation splines to make adjustments to direction and speed, and a real animation bar at the bottom displaying your key frames and etc. It's also lacking automatic interpolation between the keys so you can play test the animation without manually adding additional frames, this makes it much harder if you need an animation\nto stay within a certain number of frames. The app has an animation retargeting feature, but it could probably be rounded out a bit more to work more like Maya or Unreal. If possible, it would be helpful to make the app platform agnostic so it can work on both Windows and Mac. If thatâ€™s too much reworking, then maybe just a Mac version as well. This isnâ€™t an absolute necessity, I currently use the app with Wine, but an app that can work natively would be much better. \n\nI didnâ€™t set a budget because Iâ€™m not sure what something like this would cost, and I didnâ€™t want to discourage anyone from applying. If youâ€™re interested let me know what you think, and how much you think you could complete this for. \n\nThe source code and application is here: \n\nhttps://github.com/LaZar00/KimeraCS\n",

I would like a freelancer to propose a price for this work.  \n\nAt the site users log in with a username and password that I provide. The project to which they are assigned opens and user then adds one or more comments. There are multiple projects and multiple users so that login credentials ensures that the user accesses the correct project. I have admin rights on the site to set up projects, set up users, assign users to projects and download data collected. I need to make clear that I am not a website administrator, nor do I have deep skills in the technology. While I am tech savvy in a number of areas, and I have managed many tech development projects through Upwork and the predecessor companies. The freelancer will need to communicate with me at my level of understanding. \n\nThe site has not been used much recently and the code is now out of date.

        "description": "I have a 3D modding application for Final Fantasy VII, and itâ€™s missing critical animation tools. The main things I think it's missing are a Gizmo to move and rotate joints in 3D space, animation splines to make adjustments to direction and speed, and a real animation bar at the bottom displaying your key frames and etc. It's also lacking automatic interpolation between the keys so you can play test the animation without manually adding additional frames, this makes it much harder if you need an animation\nto stay within a certain number of frames. The app has an animation retargeting feature, but it could probably be rounded out a bit more to work more like Maya or Unreal. If possible, it would be helpful to make the app platform agnostic so it can work on both Windows and Mac. If thatâ€™s too much reworking, then maybe just a Mac version as well. This isnâ€™t an absolute necessity, I currently use the app with Wine, but an app that can work natively would be much better. \n\nI didnâ€™t set a budget because Iâ€™m not sure what something like this would cost, and I didnâ€™t want to discourage anyone from applying. If youâ€™re interested let me know what you think, and how much you think you could complete this for. \n\nThe source code and application is here: \n\nhttps://github.com/LaZar00/KimeraCS\n",

        "description": "I have a 3D modding application for Final Fantasy VII, and itâ€™s missing critical animation tools. The main things I think it's missing are a Gizmo to move and rotate joints in 3D space, animation splines to make adjustments to direction and speed, and a real animation bar at the bottom displaying your key frames and etc. It's also lacking automatic interpolation between the keys so you can play test the animation without manually adding additional frames, this makes it much harder if you need an animation\nto stay within a certain number of frames. The app has an animation retargeting feature, but it could probably be rounded out a bit more to work more like Maya or Unreal. If possible, it would be helpful to make the app platform agnostic so it can work on both Windows and Mac. If thatâ€™s too much reworking, then maybe just a Mac version as well. This isnâ€™t an absolute necessity, I currently use the app with Wine, but an app that can work natively would be much better. \n\nI didnâ€™t set a budget because Iâ€™m not sure what something like this would cost, and I didnâ€™t want to discourage anyone from applying. If youâ€™re interested let me know what you think, and how much you think you could complete this for. \n\nThe source code and application is here: \n\nhttps://github.com/LaZar00/KimeraCS\n",

The requirements are to create a Flow with the Flow Designer corresponding to a provided Visio Diagram.\nThe flow is triggered by a Catalog Item and has some if conditions that trigger on the selections the user does on previous tasks on the variables.\nFurther, there should be Notifications triggered by events at the right places in the Flow with dynamic variables included.\nAlso it is necessary to show specific variables on the Service Portal but hide them on the Ritm and task and also to make variables read only or mandatory depending on Service Portal / Ritm or Task level.\nSince the requirements are not set entirely a little bit creativity is needed. But the underlying focus is always that the Client is satisfied. \nWhen there are questions I can support and help with implementation questions or design.\n\nYou should also know how update sets work.\n\nThe Project takes about 40h And will end at mid September the latest.\n\nFeel free to apply,\nMax\n\n\n",

The onboarding journey will consist of: \n\n1) BMI calculator\n\nIf less 27, show a message to say that they donâ€™t qualify. If greater 27, take the user through the registration flow. \n\n2) Registration (numerous inputs)\n\nOnce the patient has provided the above, they will be visible within the custom built CMS. The practitioner will have a login to the CMS whereby they will be able to view the information captured by the patient. They would be able to add specific notes after the consultation and select the medication and the required gear (glucose monitor, wearable and scale) to send to the patient. The idea is that the cost of these items will be built into the system, so that the practitioner can simply select the products, which then creates the payment link. This will be centrally managed in its totality in the CMS. \nOnce the payment has been made, the kit will be delivered to the patient and the engagement with Zone.Health will be through the app. However, each month, the practitioner will log into the CMS and create a payment link based on the progress the patient is making. \n\nAll invoices and orders will be available to the patient when logging into the site. It is important to note that the onboarding portal and the mobile app (this has been developed separately and not in the scope of this project) should use the same authentication system in order to prevent the patient having to create two seperate accounts. \nDetails will be provided once engagement starts, but we expect the website to consist of:\n\no\tâ—  Project set up \no\tâ—  Information website build \no\tâ—  BMI \no\tâ—  Registration \no\tâ—  Further screening questions \no\tâ—  Laboratory Test Uploads \no\tâ—  Schedule a visit \no\tâ—  Confirmation \no\tâ—  Payment Process \no\tâ—  Account Settings \no\tâ—  CMS - View users \no\tâ—  CMS - Create payments \no\tâ—  CMS - Shipment of your ZoneHealth kit notification \no\tâ—  Email Templates Creation \no\tâ—  Email Provider Integration \no\tâ—  CRM Integration \no\tâ—  Scheduling System Integration \no\tâ—  Payment Provider Integration \nVideo Conferencing Integration \n\nThere are similar businesses in the US and we like this the most: https://joinfound.com\n\n",

I would like a freelancer to propose a price for this work.  \n\nAt the site users log in with a username and password that I provide. The project to which they are assigned opens and user then adds one or more comments. There are multiple projects and multiple users so that login credentials ensures that the user accesses the correct project. I have admin rights on the site to set up projects, set up users, assign users to projects and download data collected. I need to make clear that I am not a website administrator, nor do I have deep skills in the technology. While I am tech savvy in a number of areas, and I have managed many tech development projects through Upwork and the predecessor companies. The freelancer will need to communicate with me at my level of understanding. \n\nThe site has not been used much recently and the code is now out of date. Most parts of the site seem to work ok except when a user logs in, their project does not open. I need a freelancer to review the code and update the site (patches, fixes, etc.). I do not need a redesign or new functionality; I only need the code updated. I do have more detailed documentation that I can share with freelancers that are shortlisted. The freelancer who created the site did great work but they are not available at this time so I need a new freelancer who can do this work. \n\nI have accounts on Heroku and Vercel to support this site and the below is a brief summary of the documentation from the freelancer that created the project.\nLIBRARIES &amp; FRAMEWORKS ON THE FRONT END\nReact JS - React is an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components.\nNext JS â€“ Was used to build server-side rendering and static web applications using React.\nStyled-Components â€“ This utilizes tagged template literals to style the components.\nMaterial-UI - React components for faster and easier web development.\nJs-Cookie â€“ Is a simple, lightweight JavaScript API for handling browser cookies, this was used to read the cookie token stored in the browser and was used for authenticating users as soon as they are signed in using the form on the application.\nIsormorphic-Fetch - Isomorphic-fetch is implementation of fetch for both Node.js and browser, this was used to communicate with the backend (server) and used to fetch data stored on the server database and pulled to the frontend.\nThe rest of the libraries/frameworks can be found in the package.json file on the root directory of the project. Any developer that will be doing further work on the project can find the documentation on the README.MD file on the GitHub page useful and straightforward.\n\nLIBRARIES &amp; FRAMEWORKS ON THE BACK END\nNode JS â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side.\nExpress JS â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side.\nMongoose â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code \nJson2cvs â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side.\n\n\n \n",

I would like a freelancer to propose a price for this work.  \n\nAt the site users log in with a username and password that I provide. The project to which they are assigned opens and user then adds one or more comments. There are multiple projects and multiple users so that login credentials ensures that the user accesses the correct project. I have admin rights on the site to set up projects, set up users, assign users to projects and download data collected. I need to make clear that I am not a website administrator, nor do I have deep skills in the technology. While I am tech savvy in a number of areas, and I have managed many tech development projects through Upwork and the predecessor companies. The freelancer will need to communicate with me at my level of understanding. \n\nThe site has not been used much recently and the code is now out of date. Most parts of the site seem to work ok except when a user logs in, their project does not open. I need a freelancer to review the code and update the site (patches, fixes, etc.). I do not need a redesign or new functionality; I only need the code updated. I do have more detailed documentation that I can share with freelancers that are shortlisted. The freelancer who created the site did great work but they are not available at this time so I need a new freelancer who can do this work. \n\nI have accounts on Heroku and Vercel to support this site and the below is a brief summary of the documentation from the freelancer that created the project.\nLIBRARIES &amp; FRAMEWORKS ON THE FRONT END\nReact JS - React is an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components.\nNext JS â€“ Was used to build server-side rendering and static web applications using React.\nStyled-Components â€“ This utilizes tagged template literals to style the components.\nMaterial-UI - React components for faster and easier web development.\nJs-Cookie â€“ Is a simple, lightweight JavaScript API for handling browser cookies, this was used to read the cookie token stored in the browser and was used for authenticating users as soon as they are signed in using the form on the application.\nIsormorphic-Fetch - Isomorphic-fetch is implementation of fetch for both Node.js and browser, this was used to communicate with the backend (server) and used to fetch data stored on the server database and pulled to the frontend.\nThe rest of the libraries/frameworks can be found in the package.json file on the root directory of the project. Any developer that will be doing further work on the project can find the documentation on the README.MD file on the GitHub page useful and straightforward.\n\nLIBRARIES &amp; FRAMEWORKS ON THE BACK END\nNode JS â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side.\nExpress JS â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side.\nMongoose â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code \nJson2cvs â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side.\n\n\n \n",

        "description": "I have a 3D modding application for Final Fantasy VII, and itâ€™s missing critical animation tools. The main things I think it's missing are a Gizmo to move and rotate joints in 3D space, animation splines to make adjustments to direction and speed, and a real animation bar at the bottom displaying your key frames and etc. It's also lacking automatic interpolation between the keys so you can play test the animation without manually adding additional frames, this makes it much harder if you need an animation\nto stay within a certain number of frames. The app has an animation retargeting feature, but it could probably be rounded out a bit more to work more like Maya or Unreal. If possible, it would be helpful to make the app platform agnostic so it can work on both Windows and Mac. If thatâ€™s too much reworking, then maybe just a Mac version as well. This isnâ€™t an absolute necessity, I currently use the app with Wine, but an app that can work natively would be much better. \n\nI didnâ€™t set a budget because Iâ€™m not sure what something like this would cost, and I didnâ€™t want to discourage anyone from applying. If youâ€™re interested let me know what you think, and how much you think you could complete this for. \n\nThe source code and application is here: \n\nhttps://github.com/LaZar00/KimeraCS\n",

        "description": "GluCare was born out of the idea that a combination of a human-centric patient approach and a technology working together will lead to a better and more efficient management of diabetes and metabolic syndrome. \n\nThe GluCare team is looking to expand their successful business model from physical interaction to service in the cloud. This new offering will be called Zone.Health. The ask is to build a website that acts as the hub of information in order to get patients to join their program. The various sections of the site will consist of: \n\nâ€¢\tâ—  What is Zone.health? \nâ€¢\tâ—  The program \nâ€¢\tâ—  Why it works? \nâ€¢\tâ—  Join now \nâ€¢\tâ—  Pricing \nâ€¢\tâ—  FAQs \n\nWe envisage the website to have an onboarding portal which will consist of three parts, an API, a CMS and a Frontend system.\n\n1.\tThis will allow for future integration into other customer touch points should the need arise. The onboarding journey will consist of: \n\n1) BMI calculator\n\nIf less 27, show a message to say that they donâ€™t qualify. If greater 27, take the user through the registration flow. \n\n2) Registration (numerous inputs)\n\nOnce the patient has provided the above, they will be visible within the custom built CMS. The practitioner will have a login to the CMS whereby they will be able to view the information captured by the patient. They would be able to add specific notes after the consultation and select the medication and the required gear (glucose monitor, wearable and scale) to send to the patient. The idea is that the cost of these items will be built into the system, so that the practitioner can simply select the products, which then creates the payment link. This will be centrally managed in its totality in the CMS. \nOnce the payment has been made, the kit will be delivered to the patient and the engagement with Zone.Health will be through the app. However, each month, the practitioner will log into the CMS and create a payment link based on the progress the patient is making. \n\nAll invoices and orders will be available to the patient when logging into the site. It is important to note that the onboarding portal and the mobile app (this has been developed separately and not in the scope of this project) should use the same authentication system in order to prevent the patient having to create two seperate accounts. \nDetails will be provided once engagement starts, but we expect the website to consist of:\n\no\tâ—  Project set up \no\tâ—  Information website build \no\tâ—  BMI \no\tâ—  Registration \no\tâ—  Further screening questions \no\tâ—  Laboratory Test Uploads \no\tâ—  Schedule a visit \no\tâ—  Confirmation \no\tâ—  Payment Process \no\tâ—  Account Settings \no\tâ—  CMS - View users \no\tâ—  CMS - Create payments \no\tâ—  CMS - Shipment of your ZoneHealth kit notification \no\tâ—  Email Templates Creation \no\tâ—  Email Provider Integration \no\tâ—  CRM Integration \no\tâ—  Scheduling System Integration \no\tâ—  Payment Provider Integration \nVideo Conferencing Integration \n\nThere are similar businesses in the US and we like this the most: https://joinfound.com\n\n",

The main things I think it's missing are a Gizmo to move and rotate joints in 3D space, animation splines to make adjustments to direction and speed, and a real animation bar at the bottom displaying your key frames and etc. It's also lacking automatic interpolation between the keys so you can play test the animation without manually adding additional frames, this makes it much harder if you need an animation\nto stay within a certain number of frames. The app has an animation retargeting feature, but it could probably be rounded out a bit more to work more like Maya or Unreal. If possible, it would be helpful to make the app platform agnostic so it can work on both Windows and Mac. If thatâ€™s too much reworking, then maybe just a Mac version as well. This isnâ€™t an absolute necessity, I currently use the app with Wine, but an app that can work natively would be much better. \n\nI didnâ€™t set a budget because Iâ€™m not sure what something like this would cost, and I didnâ€™t want to discourage anyone from applying. If youâ€™re interested let me know what you think, and how much you think you could complete this for. \n\nThe source code and application is here: \n\nhttps://github.com/LaZar00/KimeraCS\n",

        "description": "I have an interactive website that needs to be updated. The purpose of the site is to collect comments from users who are directed to the site. I would like a freelancer to propose a price for this work.  \n\nAt the site users log in with a username and password that I provide. The project to which they are assigned opens and user then adds one or more comments. There are multiple projects and multiple users so that login credentials ensures that the user accesses the correct project. I have admin rights on the site to set up projects, set up users, assign users to projects and download data collected. I need to make clear that I am not a website administrator, nor do I have deep skills in the technology. While I am tech savvy in a number of areas, and I have managed many tech development projects through Upwork and the predecessor companies. The freelancer will need to communicate with me at my level of understanding. \n\nThe site has not been used much recently and the code is now out of date. Most parts of the site seem to work ok except when a user logs in, their project does not open. I need a freelancer to review the code and update the site (patches, fixes, etc.). I do not need a redesign or new functionality; I only need the code updated. I do have more detailed documentation that I can share with freelancers that are shortlisted. The freelancer who created the site did great work but they are not available at this time so I need a new freelancer who can do this work. \n\nI have accounts on Heroku and Vercel to support this site and the below is a brief summary of the documentation from the freelancer that created the project.\nLIBRARIES &amp; FRAMEWORKS ON THE FRONT END\nReact JS - React is an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components.\nNext JS â€“ Was used to build server-side rendering and static web applications using React.\nStyled-Components â€“ This utilizes tagged template literals to style the components.\nMaterial-UI - React components for faster and easier web development.\nJs-Cookie â€“ Is a simple, lightweight JavaScript API for handling browser cookies, this was used to read the cookie token stored in the browser and was used for authenticating users as soon as they are signed in using the form on the application.\nIsormorphic-Fetch - Isomorphic-fetch is implementation of fetch for both Node.js and browser, this was used to communicate with the backend (server) and used to fetch data stored on the server database and pulled to the frontend.\nThe rest of the libraries/frameworks can be found in the package.json file on the root directory of the project. Any developer that will be doing further work on the project can find the documentation on the README.MD file on the GitHub page useful and straightforward.\n\nLIBRARIES &amp; FRAMEWORKS ON THE BACK END\nNode JS â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side.\nExpress JS â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side.\nMongoose â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code \nJson2cvs â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side.\n\n\n \n",

        "description": "GluCare was born out of the idea that a combination of a human-centric patient approach and a technology working together will lead to a better and more efficient management of diabetes and metabolic syndrome. \n\nThe GluCare team is looking to expand their successful business model from physical interaction to service in the cloud. This new offering will be called Zone.Health. The ask is to build a website that acts as the hub of information in order to get patients to join their program. The various sections of the site will consist of: \n\nâ€¢\tâ—  What is Zone.health? \nâ€¢\tâ—  The program \nâ€¢\tâ—  Why it works? \nâ€¢\tâ—  Join now \nâ€¢\tâ—  Pricing \nâ€¢\tâ—  FAQs \n\nWe envisage the website to have an onboarding portal which will consist of three parts, an API, a CMS and a Frontend system.\n\n1.\tThis will allow for future integration into other customer touch points should the need arise. The onboarding journey will consist of: \n\n1) BMI calculator\n\nIf less 27, show a message to say that they donâ€™t qualify. If greater 27, take the user through the registration flow. \n\n2) Registration (numerous inputs)\n\nOnce the patient has provided the above, they will be visible within the custom built CMS. The practitioner will have a login to the CMS whereby they will be able to view the information captured by the patient. They would be able to add specific notes after the consultation and select the medication and the required gear (glucose monitor, wearable and scale) to send to the patient. The idea is that the cost of these items will be built into the system, so that the practitioner can simply select the products, which then creates the payment link. This will be centrally managed in its totality in the CMS. \nOnce the payment has been made, the kit will be delivered to the patient and the engagement with Zone.Health will be through the app. However, each month, the practitioner will log into the CMS and create a payment link based on the progress the patient is making. \n\nAll invoices and orders will be available to the patient when logging into the site. It is important to note that the onboarding portal and the mobile app (this has been developed separately and not in the scope of this project) should use the same authentication system in order to prevent the patient having to create two seperate accounts. \nDetails will be provided once engagement starts, but we expect the website to consist of:\n\no\tâ—  Project set up \no\tâ—  Information website build \no\tâ—  BMI \no\tâ—  Registration \no\tâ—  Further screening questions \no\tâ—  Laboratory Test Uploads \no\tâ—  Schedule a visit \no\tâ—  Confirmation \no\tâ—  Payment Process \no\tâ—  Account Settings \no\tâ—  CMS - View users \no\tâ—  CMS - Create payments \no\tâ—  CMS - Shipment of your ZoneHealth kit notification \no\tâ—  Email Templates Creation \no\tâ—  Email Provider Integration \no\tâ—  CRM Integration \no\tâ—  Scheduling System Integration \no\tâ—  Payment Provider Integration \nVideo Conferencing Integration \n\nThere are similar businesses in the US and we like this the most: https://joinfound.com\n\n",

I would like a freelancer to propose a price for this work.  \n\nAt the site users log in with a username and password that I provide. The project to which they are assigned opens and user then adds one or more comments. There are multiple projects and multiple users so that login credentials ensures that the user accesses the correct project. I have admin rights on the site to set up projects, set up users, assign users to projects and download data collected. I need to make clear that I am not a website administrator, nor do I have deep skills in the technology. While I am tech savvy in a number of areas, and I have managed many tech development projects through Upwork and the predecessor companies. The freelancer will need to communicate with me at my level of understanding. \n\nThe site has not been used much recently and the code is now out of date. Most parts of the site seem to work ok except when a user logs in, their project does not open. I need a freelancer to review the code and update the site (patches, fixes, etc.). I do not need a redesign or new functionality; I only need the code updated. I do have more detailed documentation that I can share with freelancers that are shortlisted. The freelancer who created the site did great work but they are not available at this time so I need a new freelancer who can do this work. \n\nI have accounts on Heroku and Vercel to support this site and the below is a brief summary of the documentation from the freelancer that created the project.\nLIBRARIES &amp; FRAMEWORKS ON THE FRONT END\nReact JS - React is an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components.\nNext JS â€“ Was used to build server-side rendering and static web applications using React.\nStyled-Components â€“ This utilizes tagged template literals to style the components.\nMaterial-UI - React components for faster and easier web development.\nJs-Cookie â€“ Is a simple, lightweight JavaScript API for handling browser cookies, this was used to read the cookie token stored in the browser and was used for authenticating users as soon as they are signed in using the form on the application.\nIsormorphic-Fetch - Isomorphic-fetch is implementation of fetch for both Node.js and browser, this was used to communicate with the backend (server) and used to fetch data stored on the server database and pulled to the frontend.\nThe rest of the libraries/frameworks can be found in the package.json file on the root directory of the project. Any developer that will be doing further work on the project can find the documentation on the README.MD file on the GitHub page useful and straightforward.\n\nLIBRARIES &amp; FRAMEWORKS ON THE BACK END\nNode JS â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side.\nExpress JS â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side.\nMongoose â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code \nJson2cvs â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side.\n\n\n \n",

        "description": "GluCare was born out of the idea that a combination of a human-centric patient approach and a technology working together will lead to a better and more efficient management of diabetes and metabolic syndrome. \n\nThe GluCare team is looking to expand their successful business model from physical interaction to service in the cloud. This new offering will be called Zone.Health. The ask is to build a website that acts as the hub of information in order to get patients to join their program. The various sections of the site will consist of: \n\nâ€¢\tâ—  What is Zone.health? \nâ€¢\tâ—  The program \nâ€¢\tâ—  Why it works? \nâ€¢\tâ—  Join now \nâ€¢\tâ—  Pricing \nâ€¢\tâ—  FAQs \n\nWe envisage the website to have an onboarding portal which will consist of three parts, an API, a CMS and a Frontend system.\n\n1.\tThis will allow for future integration into other customer touch points should the need arise. The onboarding journey will consist of: \n\n1) BMI calculator\n\nIf less 27, show a message to say that they donâ€™t qualify. If greater 27, take the user through the registration flow. \n\n2) Registration (numerous inputs)\n\nOnce the patient has provided the above, they will be visible within the custom built CMS. The practitioner will have a login to the CMS whereby they will be able to view the information captured by the patient. They would be able to add specific notes after the consultation and select the medication and the required gear (glucose monitor, wearable and scale) to send to the patient. The idea is that the cost of these items will be built into the system, so that the practitioner can simply select the products, which then creates the payment link. This will be centrally managed in its totality in the CMS. \nOnce the payment has been made, the kit will be delivered to the patient and the engagement with Zone.Health will be through the app. However, each month, the practitioner will log into the CMS and create a payment link based on the progress the patient is making. \n\nAll invoices and orders will be available to the patient when logging into the site. It is important to note that the onboarding portal and the mobile app (this has been developed separately and not in the scope of this project) should use the same authentication system in order to prevent the patient having to create two seperate accounts. \nDetails will be provided once engagement starts, but we expect the website to consist of:\n\no\tâ—  Project set up \no\tâ—  Information website build \no\tâ—  BMI \no\tâ—  Registration \no\tâ—  Further screening questions \no\tâ—  Laboratory Test Uploads \no\tâ—  Schedule a visit \no\tâ—  Confirmation \no\tâ—  Payment Process \no\tâ—  Account Settings \no\tâ—  CMS - View users \no\tâ—  CMS - Create payments \no\tâ—  CMS - Shipment of your ZoneHealth kit notification \no\tâ—  Email Templates Creation \no\tâ—  Email Provider Integration \no\tâ—  CRM Integration \no\tâ—  Scheduling System Integration \no\tâ—  Payment Provider Integration \nVideo Conferencing Integration \n\nThere are similar businesses in the US and we like this the most: https://joinfound.com\n\n",

I would like a freelancer to propose a price for this work.  \n\nAt the site users log in with a username and password that I provide. The project to which they are assigned opens and user then adds one or more comments. There are multiple projects and multiple users so that login credentials ensures that the user accesses the correct project. I have admin rights on the site to set up projects, set up users, assign users to projects and download data collected. I need to make clear that I am not a website administrator, nor do I have deep skills in the technology. While I am tech savvy in a number of areas, and I have managed many tech development projects through Upwork and the predecessor companies. The freelancer will need to communicate with me at my level of understanding. \n\nThe site has not been used much recently and the code is now out of date. Most parts of the site seem to work ok except when a user logs in, their project does not open. I need a freelancer to review the code and update the site (patches, fixes, etc.). I do not need a redesign or new functionality; I only need the code updated. I do have more detailed documentation that I can share with freelancers that are shortlisted. The freelancer who created the site did great work but they are not available at this time so I need a new freelancer who can do this work. \n\nI have accounts on Heroku and Vercel to support this site and the below is a brief summary of the documentation from the freelancer that created the project.\nLIBRARIES &amp; FRAMEWORKS ON THE FRONT END\nReact JS - React is an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components.\nNext JS â€“ Was used to build server-side rendering and static web applications using React.\nStyled-Components â€“ This utilizes tagged template literals to style the components.\nMaterial-UI - React components for faster and easier web development.\nJs-Cookie â€“ Is a simple, lightweight JavaScript API for handling browser cookies, this was used to read the cookie token stored in the browser and was used for authenticating users as soon as they are signed in using the form on the application.\nIsormorphic-Fetch - Isomorphic-fetch is implementation of fetch for both Node.js and browser, this was used to communicate with the backend (server) and used to fetch data stored on the server database and pulled to the frontend.\nThe rest of the libraries/frameworks can be found in the package.json file on the root directory of the project. Any developer that will be doing further work on the project can find the documentation on the README.MD file on the GitHub page useful and straightforward.\n\nLIBRARIES &amp; FRAMEWORKS ON THE BACK END\nNode JS â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side.\nExpress JS â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side.\nMongoose â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code \nJson2cvs â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side.\n\n\n \n",

        "description": "I have a 3D modding application for Final Fantasy VII, and itâ€™s missing critical animation tools. The main things I think it's missing are a Gizmo to move and rotate joints in 3D space, animation splines to make adjustments to direction and speed, and a real animation bar at the bottom displaying your key frames and etc. It's also lacking automatic interpolation between the keys so you can play test the animation without manually adding additional frames, this makes it much harder if you need an animation\nto stay within a certain number of frames. The app has an animation retargeting feature, but it could probably be rounded out a bit more to work more like Maya or Unreal. If possible, it would be helpful to make the app platform agnostic so it can work on both Windows and Mac. If thatâ€™s too much reworking, then maybe just a Mac version as well. This isnâ€™t an absolute necessity, I currently use the app with Wine, but an app that can work natively would be much better. \n\nI didnâ€™t set a budget because Iâ€™m not sure what something like this would cost, and I didnâ€™t want to discourage anyone from applying. If youâ€™re interested let me know what you think, and how much you think you could complete this for. \n\nThe source code and application is here: \n\nhttps://github.com/LaZar00/KimeraCS\n",

        "description": "I have an interactive website that needs to be updated. The purpose of the site is to collect comments from users who are directed to the site. I would like a freelancer to propose a price for this work.  \n\nAt the site users log in with a username and password that I provide. The project to which they are assigned opens and user then adds one or more comments. There are multiple projects and multiple users so that login credentials ensures that the user accesses the correct project. I have admin rights on the site to set up projects, set up users, assign users to projects and download data collected. I need to make clear that I am not a website administrator, nor do I have deep skills in the technology. While I am tech savvy in a number of areas, and I have managed many tech development projects through Upwork and the predecessor companies. The freelancer will need to communicate with me at my level of understanding. \n\nThe site has not been used much recently and the code is now out of date. Most parts of the site seem to work ok except when a user logs in, their project does not open. I need a freelancer to review the code and update the site (patches, fixes, etc.). I do not need a redesign or new functionality; I only need the code updated. I do have more detailed documentation that I can share with freelancers that are shortlisted. The freelancer who created the site did great work but they are not available at this time so I need a new freelancer who can do this work. \n\nI have accounts on Heroku and Vercel to support this site and the below is a brief summary of the documentation from the freelancer that created the project.\nLIBRARIES &amp; FRAMEWORKS ON THE FRONT END\nReact JS - React is an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components.\nNext JS â€“ Was used to build server-side rendering and static web applications using React.\nStyled-Components â€“ This utilizes tagged template literals to style the components.\nMaterial-UI - React components for faster and easier web development.\nJs-Cookie â€“ Is a simple, lightweight JavaScript API for handling browser cookies, this was used to read the cookie token stored in the browser and was used for authenticating users as soon as they are signed in using the form on the application.\nIsormorphic-Fetch - Isomorphic-fetch is implementation of fetch for both Node.js and browser, this was used to communicate with the backend (server) and used to fetch data stored on the server database and pulled to the frontend.\nThe rest of the libraries/frameworks can be found in the package.json file on the root directory of the project. Any developer that will be doing further work on the project can find the documentation on the README.MD file on the GitHub page useful and straightforward.\n\nLIBRARIES &amp; FRAMEWORKS ON THE BACK END\nNode JS â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side.\nExpress JS â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side.\nMongoose â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code \nJson2cvs â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side.\n\n\n \n",

        "description": "GluCare was born out of the idea that a combination of a human-centric patient approach and a technology working together will lead to a better and more efficient management of diabetes and metabolic syndrome. \n\nThe GluCare team is looking to expand their successful business model from physical interaction to service in the cloud. This new offering will be called Zone.Health. The ask is to build a website that acts as the hub of information in order to get patients to join their program. The various sections of the site will consist of: \n\nâ€¢\tâ—  What is Zone.health? \nâ€¢\tâ—  The program \nâ€¢\tâ—  Why it works? \nâ€¢\tâ—  Join now \nâ€¢\tâ—  Pricing \nâ€¢\tâ—  FAQs \n\nWe envisage the website to have an onboarding portal which will consist of three parts, an API, a CMS and a Frontend system.\n\n1.\tThis will allow for future integration into other customer touch points should the need arise. The onboarding journey will consist of: \n\n1) BMI calculator\n\nIf less 27, show a message to say that they donâ€™t qualify. If greater 27, take the user through the registration flow. \n\n2) Registration (numerous inputs)\n\nOnce the patient has provided the above, they will be visible within the custom built CMS. The practitioner will have a login to the CMS whereby they will be able to view the information captured by the patient. They would be able to add specific notes after the consultation and select the medication and the required gear (glucose monitor, wearable and scale) to send to the patient. The idea is that the cost of these items will be built into the system, so that the practitioner can simply select the products, which then creates the payment link. This will be centrally managed in its totality in the CMS. \nOnce the payment has been made, the kit will be delivered to the patient and the engagement with Zone.Health will be through the app. However, each month, the practitioner will log into the CMS and create a payment link based on the progress the patient is making. \n\nAll invoices and orders will be available to the patient when logging into the site. It is important to note that the onboarding portal and the mobile app (this has been developed separately and not in the scope of this project) should use the same authentication system in order to prevent the patient having to create two seperate accounts. \nDetails will be provided once engagement starts, but we expect the website to consist of:\n\no\tâ—  Project set up \no\tâ—  Information website build \no\tâ—  BMI \no\tâ—  Registration \no\tâ—  Further screening questions \no\tâ—  Laboratory Test Uploads \no\tâ—  Schedule a visit \no\tâ—  Confirmation \no\tâ—  Payment Process \no\tâ—  Account Settings \no\tâ—  CMS - View users \no\tâ—  CMS - Create payments \no\tâ—  CMS - Shipment of your ZoneHealth kit notification \no\tâ—  Email Templates Creation \no\tâ—  Email Provider Integration \no\tâ—  CRM Integration \no\tâ—  Scheduling System Integration \no\tâ—  Payment Provider Integration \nVideo Conferencing Integration \n\nThere are similar businesses in the US and we like this the most: https://joinfound.com\n\n",

The project to which they are assigned opens and user then adds one or more comments. There are multiple projects and multiple users so that login credentials ensures that the user accesses the correct project.

I need to make clear that I am not a website administrator, nor do I have deep skills in the technology.

        "description": "I would like someone to pull all the publicly available Uber data of the city of Miami from https://movement.uber.com/explore/miami/travel-times\n\nWith the data provided, is it possible (with this data) to figure out how many rides come from each zone/neighborhood of Miami? I think we need to extrapolate that based on the number of rows but I'm not sure, so I need your help to figure this out. I was having trouble because the dataset is too large to open it all at once in Excel.\n\nOnce you know the number rides coming *out* of each zone/neighborhood:\n\n1. Break the data down and put it into excel based on all the categories that they have already tagged the data with but do it by zone/neighborhood: \n\nRides by Hour of Day (All Days)\t\nRides  by Hour of Day (Weekdays Only)\t\nRides  by Hour of Day (Weekends Only)\t\nRides  by Day of Week\t\nRides  by Month (All Days)\t\nRides  by Month (Weekdays Only)\t\nRides  by Month (Weekends Only)\t\nRides  By Date By Hour Buckets (All Days)\n\n2. Create visuals for each each zone in a manner that you feel is the ideal way to present it. Open to suggestions here.\n\nThank you.",

        "description": "I have a 3D modding application for Final Fantasy VII, and itâ€™s missing critical animation tools. The main things I think it's missing are a Gizmo to move and rotate joints in 3D space, animation splines to make adjustments to direction and speed, and a real animation bar at the bottom displaying your key frames and etc. It's also lacking automatic interpolation between the keys so you can play test the animation without manually adding additional frames, this makes it much harder if you need an animation\nto stay within a certain number of frames. The app has an animation retargeting feature, but it could probably be rounded out a bit more to work more like Maya or Unreal. If possible, it would be helpful to make the app platform agnostic so it can work on both Windows and Mac. If thatâ€™s too much reworking, then maybe just a Mac version as well. This isnâ€™t an absolute necessity, I currently use the app with Wine, but an app that can work natively would be much better. \n\nI didnâ€™t set a budget because Iâ€™m not sure what something like this would cost, and I didnâ€™t want to discourage anyone from applying. If youâ€™re interested let me know what you think, and how much you think you could complete this for. \n\nThe source code and application is here: \n\nhttps://github.com/LaZar00/KimeraCS\n",

        "description": "I have a 3D modding application for Final Fantasy VII, and itâ€™s missing critical animation tools. The main things I think it's missing are a Gizmo to move and rotate joints in 3D space, animation splines to make adjustments to direction and speed, and a real animation bar at the bottom displaying your key frames and etc. It's also lacking automatic interpolation between the keys so you can play test the animation without manually adding additional frames, this makes it much harder if you need an animation\nto stay within a certain number of frames. The app has an animation retargeting feature, but it could probably be rounded out a bit more to work more like Maya or Unreal. If possible, it would be helpful to make the app platform agnostic so it can work on both Windows and Mac. If thatâ€™s too much reworking, then maybe just a Mac version as well. This isnâ€™t an absolute necessity, I currently use the app with Wine, but an app that can work natively would be much better. \n\nI didnâ€™t set a budget because Iâ€™m not sure what something like this would cost, and I didnâ€™t want to discourage anyone from applying. If youâ€™re interested let me know what you think, and how much you think you could complete this for. \n\nThe source code and application is here: \n\nhttps://github.com/LaZar00/KimeraCS\n",

        "description": "I have a 3D modding application for Final Fantasy VII, and itâ€™s missing critical animation tools. The main things I think it's missing are a Gizmo to move and rotate joints in 3D space, animation splines to make adjustments to direction and speed, and a real animation bar at the bottom displaying your key frames and etc. It's also lacking automatic interpolation between the keys so you can play test the animation without manually adding additional frames, this makes it much harder if you need an animation\nto stay within a certain number of frames. The app has an animation retargeting feature, but it could probably be rounded out a bit more to work more like Maya or Unreal. If possible, it would be helpful to make the app platform agnostic so it can work on both Windows and Mac. If thatâ€™s too much reworking, then maybe just a Mac version as well. This isnâ€™t an absolute necessity, I currently use the app with Wine, but an app that can work natively would be much better. \n\nI didnâ€™t set a budget because Iâ€™m not sure what something like this would cost, and I didnâ€™t want to discourage anyone from applying. If youâ€™re interested let me know what you think, and how much you think you could complete this for. \n\nThe source code and application is here: \n\nhttps://github.com/LaZar00/KimeraCS\n",

I would like a freelancer to propose a price for this work.  \n\nAt the site users log in with a username and password that I provide. The project to which they are assigned opens and user then adds one or more comments. There are multiple projects and multiple users so that login credentials ensures that the user accesses the correct project. I have admin rights on the site to set up projects, set up users, assign users to projects and download data collected. I need to make clear that I am not a website administrator, nor do I have deep skills in the technology. While I am tech savvy in a number of areas, and I have managed many tech development projects through Upwork and the predecessor companies. The freelancer will need to communicate with me at my level of understanding. \n\nThe site has not been used much recently and the code is now out of date. Most parts of the site seem to work ok except when a user logs in, their project does not open. I need a freelancer to review the code and update the site (patches, fixes, etc.). I do not need a redesign or new functionality; I only need the code updated. I do have more detailed documentation that I can share with freelancers that are shortlisted. The freelancer who created the site did great work but they are not available at this time so I need a new freelancer who can do this work. \n\nI have accounts on Heroku and Vercel to support this site and the below is a brief summary of the documentation from the freelancer that created the project.\nLIBRARIES &amp; FRAMEWORKS ON THE FRONT END\nReact JS - React is an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components.\nNext JS â€“ Was used to build server-side rendering and static web applications using React.\nStyled-Components â€“ This utilizes tagged template literals to style the components.\nMaterial-UI - React components for faster and easier web development.\nJs-Cookie â€“ Is a simple, lightweight JavaScript API for handling browser cookies, this was used to read the cookie token stored in the browser and was used for authenticating users as soon as they are signed in using the form on the application.\nIsormorphic-Fetch - Isomorphic-fetch is implementation of fetch for both Node.js and browser, this was used to communicate with the backend (server) and used to fetch data stored on the server database and pulled to the frontend.\nThe rest of the libraries/frameworks can be found in the package.json file on the root directory of the project. Any developer that will be doing further work on the project can find the documentation on the README.MD file on the GitHub page useful and straightforward.\n\nLIBRARIES &amp; FRAMEWORKS ON THE BACK END\nNode JS â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side.\nExpress JS â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side.\nMongoose â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code \nJson2cvs â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side.\n\n\n \n",

        "description": "I have a 3D modding application for Final Fantasy VII, and itâ€™s missing critical animation tools. The main things I think it's missing are a Gizmo to move and rotate joints in 3D space, animation splines to make adjustments to direction and speed, and a real animation bar at the bottom displaying your key frames and etc. It's also lacking automatic interpolation between the keys so you can play test the animation without manually adding additional frames, this makes it much harder if you need an animation\nto stay within a certain number of frames. The app has an animation retargeting feature, but it could probably be rounded out a bit more to work more like Maya or Unreal. If possible, it would be helpful to make the app platform agnostic so it can work on both Windows and Mac. If thatâ€™s too much reworking, then maybe just a Mac version as well. This isnâ€™t an absolute necessity, I currently use the app with Wine, but an app that can work natively would be much better. \n\nI didnâ€™t set a budget because Iâ€™m not sure what something like this would cost, and I didnâ€™t want to discourage anyone from applying. If youâ€™re interested let me know what you think, and how much you think you could complete this for. \n\nThe source code and application is here: \n\nhttps://github.com/LaZar00/KimeraCS\n",

        "description": "I have a 3D modding application for Final Fantasy VII, and itâ€™s missing critical animation tools. The main things I think it's missing are a Gizmo to move and rotate joints in 3D space, animation splines to make adjustments to direction and speed, and a real animation bar at the bottom displaying your key frames and etc. It's also lacking automatic interpolation between the keys so you can play test the animation without manually adding additional frames, this makes it much harder if you need an animation\nto stay within a certain number of frames. The app has an animation retargeting feature, but it could probably be rounded out a bit more to work more like Maya or Unreal. If possible, it would be helpful to make the app platform agnostic so it can work on both Windows and Mac. If thatâ€™s too much reworking, then maybe just a Mac version as well. This isnâ€™t an absolute necessity, I currently use the app with Wine, but an app that can work natively would be much better. \n\nI didnâ€™t set a budget because Iâ€™m not sure what something like this would cost, and I didnâ€™t want to discourage anyone from applying. If youâ€™re interested let me know what you think, and how much you think you could complete this for. \n\nThe source code and application is here: \n\nhttps://github.com/LaZar00/KimeraCS\n",

        "description": "GluCare was born out of the idea that a combination of a human-centric patient approach and a technology working together will lead to a better and more efficient management of diabetes and metabolic syndrome. \n\nThe GluCare team is looking to expand their successful business model from physical interaction to service in the cloud. This new offering will be called Zone.Health. The ask is to build a website that acts as the hub of information in order to get patients to join their program. The various sections of the site will consist of: \n\nâ€¢\tâ—  What is Zone.health? \nâ€¢\tâ—  The program \nâ€¢\tâ—  Why it works? \nâ€¢\tâ—  Join now \nâ€¢\tâ—  Pricing \nâ€¢\tâ—  FAQs \n\nWe envisage the website to have an onboarding portal which will consist of three parts, an API, a CMS and a Frontend system.\n\n1.\tThis will allow for future integration into other customer touch points should the need arise. The onboarding journey will consist of: \n\n1) BMI calculator\n\nIf less 27, show a message to say that they donâ€™t qualify. If greater 27, take the user through the registration flow. \n\n2) Registration (numerous inputs)\n\nOnce the patient has provided the above, they will be visible within the custom built CMS. The practitioner will have a login to the CMS whereby they will be able to view the information captured by the patient. They would be able to add specific notes after the consultation and select the medication and the required gear (glucose monitor, wearable and scale) to send to the patient. The idea is that the cost of these items will be built into the system, so that the practitioner can simply select the products, which then creates the payment link. This will be centrally managed in its totality in the CMS. \nOnce the payment has been made, the kit will be delivered to the patient and the engagement with Zone.Health will be through the app. However, each month, the practitioner will log into the CMS and create a payment link based on the progress the patient is making. \n\nAll invoices and orders will be available to the patient when logging into the site. It is important to note that the onboarding portal and the mobile app (this has been developed separately and not in the scope of this project) should use the same authentication system in order to prevent the patient having to create two seperate accounts. \nDetails will be provided once engagement starts, but we expect the website to consist of:\n\no\tâ—  Project set up \no\tâ—  Information website build \no\tâ—  BMI \no\tâ—  Registration \no\tâ—  Further screening questions \no\tâ—  Laboratory Test Uploads \no\tâ—  Schedule a visit \no\tâ—  Confirmation \no\tâ—  Payment Process \no\tâ—  Account Settings \no\tâ—  CMS - View users \no\tâ—  CMS - Create payments \no\tâ—  CMS - Shipment of your ZoneHealth kit notification \no\tâ—  Email Templates Creation \no\tâ—  Email Provider Integration \no\tâ—  CRM Integration \no\tâ—  Scheduling System Integration \no\tâ—  Payment Provider Integration \nVideo Conferencing Integration \n\nThere are similar businesses in the US and we like this the most: https://joinfound.com\n\n",

I would like a freelancer to propose a price for this work.  \n\nAt the site users log in with a username and password that I provide. The project to which they are assigned opens and user then adds one or more comments. There are multiple projects and multiple users so that login credentials ensures that the user accesses the correct project. I have admin rights on the site to set up projects, set up users, assign users to projects and download data collected. I need to make clear that I am not a website administrator, nor do I have deep skills in the technology. While I am tech savvy in a number of areas, and I have managed many tech development projects through Upwork and the predecessor companies. The freelancer will need to communicate with me at my level of understanding. \n\nThe site has not been used much recently and the code is now out of date. Most parts of the site seem to work ok except when a user logs in, their project does not open. I need a freelancer to review the code and update the site (patches, fixes, etc.). I do not need a redesign or new functionality; I only need the code updated. I do have more detailed documentation that I can share with freelancers that are shortlisted. The freelancer who created the site did great work but they are not available at this time so I need a new freelancer who can do this work. \n\nI have accounts on Heroku and Vercel to support this site and the below is a brief summary of the documentation from the freelancer that created the project.\nLIBRARIES &amp; FRAMEWORKS ON THE FRONT END\nReact JS - React is an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components.\nNext JS â€“ Was used to build server-side rendering and static web applications using React.\nStyled-Components â€“ This utilizes tagged template literals to style the components.\nMaterial-UI - React components for faster and easier web development.\nJs-Cookie â€“ Is a simple, lightweight JavaScript API for handling browser cookies, this was used to read the cookie token stored in the browser and was used for authenticating users as soon as they are signed in using the form on the application.\nIsormorphic-Fetch - Isomorphic-fetch is implementation of fetch for both Node.js and browser, this was used to communicate with the backend (server) and used to fetch data stored on the server database and pulled to the frontend.\nThe rest of the libraries/frameworks can be found in the package.json file on the root directory of the project. Any developer that will be doing further work on the project can find the documentation on the README.MD file on the GitHub page useful and straightforward.\n\nLIBRARIES &amp; FRAMEWORKS ON THE BACK END\nNode JS â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side.\nExpress JS â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side.\nMongoose â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code \nJson2cvs â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side.\n\n\n \n",

        "description": "I have a 3D modding application for Final Fantasy VII, and itâ€™s missing critical animation tools. The main things I think it's missing are a Gizmo to move and rotate joints in 3D space, animation splines to make adjustments to direction and speed, and a real animation bar at the bottom displaying your key frames and etc. It's also lacking automatic interpolation between the keys so you can play test the animation without manually adding additional frames, this makes it much harder if you need an animation\nto stay within a certain number of frames. The app has an animation retargeting feature, but it could probably be rounded out a bit more to work more like Maya or Unreal. If possible, it would be helpful to make the app platform agnostic so it can work on both Windows and Mac. If thatâ€™s too much reworking, then maybe just a Mac version as well. This isnâ€™t an absolute necessity, I currently use the app with Wine, but an app that can work natively would be much better. \n\nI didnâ€™t set a budget because Iâ€™m not sure what something like this would cost, and I didnâ€™t want to discourage anyone from applying. If youâ€™re interested let me know what you think, and how much you think you could complete this for. \n\nThe source code and application is here: \n\nhttps://github.com/LaZar00/KimeraCS\n",

        "description": "GluCare was born out of the idea that a combination of a human-centric patient approach and a technology working together will lead to a better and more efficient management of diabetes and metabolic syndrome. \n\nThe GluCare team is looking to expand their successful business model from physical interaction to service in the cloud. This new offering will be called Zone.Health. The ask is to build a website that acts as the hub of information in order to get patients to join their program. The various sections of the site will consist of: \n\nâ€¢\tâ—  What is Zone.health? \nâ€¢\tâ—  The program \nâ€¢\tâ—  Why it works? \nâ€¢\tâ—  Join now \nâ€¢\tâ—  Pricing \nâ€¢\tâ—  FAQs \n\nWe envisage the website to have an onboarding portal which will consist of three parts, an API, a CMS and a Frontend system.\n\n1.\tThis will allow for future integration into other customer touch points should the need arise. The onboarding journey will consist of: \n\n1) BMI calculator\n\nIf less 27, show a message to say that they donâ€™t qualify. If greater 27, take the user through the registration flow. \n\n2) Registration (numerous inputs)\n\nOnce the patient has provided the above, they will be visible within the custom built CMS. The practitioner will have a login to the CMS whereby they will be able to view the information captured by the patient. They would be able to add specific notes after the consultation and select the medication and the required gear (glucose monitor, wearable and scale) to send to the patient. The idea is that the cost of these items will be built into the system, so that the practitioner can simply select the products, which then creates the payment link. This will be centrally managed in its totality in the CMS. \nOnce the payment has been made, the kit will be delivered to the patient and the engagement with Zone.Health will be through the app. However, each month, the practitioner will log into the CMS and create a payment link based on the progress the patient is making. \n\nAll invoices and orders will be available to the patient when logging into the site. It is important to note that the onboarding portal and the mobile app (this has been developed separately and not in the scope of this project) should use the same authentication system in order to prevent the patient having to create two seperate accounts. \nDetails will be provided once engagement starts, but we expect the website to consist of:\n\no\tâ—  Project set up \no\tâ—  Information website build \no\tâ—  BMI \no\tâ—  Registration \no\tâ—  Further screening questions \no\tâ—  Laboratory Test Uploads \no\tâ—  Schedule a visit \no\tâ—  Confirmation \no\tâ—  Payment Process \no\tâ—  Account Settings \no\tâ—  CMS - View users \no\tâ—  CMS - Create payments \no\tâ—  CMS - Shipment of your ZoneHealth kit notification \no\tâ—  Email Templates Creation \no\tâ—  Email Provider Integration \no\tâ—  CRM Integration \no\tâ—  Scheduling System Integration \no\tâ—  Payment Provider Integration \nVideo Conferencing Integration \n\nThere are similar businesses in the US and we like this the most: https://joinfound.com\n\n",

        "description": "GluCare was born out of the idea that a combination of a human-centric patient approach and a technology working together will lead to a better and more efficient management of diabetes and metabolic syndrome. \n\nThe GluCare team is looking to expand their successful business model from physical interaction to service in the cloud. This new offering will be called Zone.Health. The ask is to build a website that acts as the hub of information in order to get patients to join their program. The various sections of the site will consist of: \n\nâ€¢\tâ—  What is Zone.health? \nâ€¢\tâ—  The program \nâ€¢\tâ—  Why it works? \nâ€¢\tâ—  Join now \nâ€¢\tâ—  Pricing \nâ€¢\tâ—  FAQs \n\nWe envisage the website to have an onboarding portal which will consist of three parts, an API, a CMS and a Frontend system.\n\n1.\tThis will allow for future integration into other customer touch points should the need arise. The onboarding journey will consist of: \n\n1) BMI calculator\n\nIf less 27, show a message to say that they donâ€™t qualify. If greater 27, take the user through the registration flow. \n\n2) Registration (numerous inputs)\n\nOnce the patient has provided the above, they will be visible within the custom built CMS. The practitioner will have a login to the CMS whereby they will be able to view the information captured by the patient. They would be able to add specific notes after the consultation and select the medication and the required gear (glucose monitor, wearable and scale) to send to the patient. The idea is that the cost of these items will be built into the system, so that the practitioner can simply select the products, which then creates the payment link. This will be centrally managed in its totality in the CMS. \nOnce the payment has been made, the kit will be delivered to the patient and the engagement with Zone.Health will be through the app. However, each month, the practitioner will log into the CMS and create a payment link based on the progress the patient is making. \n\nAll invoices and orders will be available to the patient when logging into the site. It is important to note that the onboarding portal and the mobile app (this has been developed separately and not in the scope of this project) should use the same authentication system in order to prevent the patient having to create two seperate accounts. \nDetails will be provided once engagement starts, but we expect the website to consist of:\n\no\tâ—  Project set up \no\tâ—  Information website build \no\tâ—  BMI \no\tâ—  Registration \no\tâ—  Further screening questions \no\tâ—  Laboratory Test Uploads \no\tâ—  Schedule a visit \no\tâ—  Confirmation \no\tâ—  Payment Process \no\tâ—  Account Settings \no\tâ—  CMS - View users \no\tâ—  CMS - Create payments \no\tâ—  CMS - Shipment of your ZoneHealth kit notification \no\tâ—  Email Templates Creation \no\tâ—  Email Provider Integration \no\tâ—  CRM Integration \no\tâ—  Scheduling System Integration \no\tâ—  Payment Provider Integration \nVideo Conferencing Integration \n\nThere are similar businesses in the US and we like this the most: https://joinfound.com\n\n",

        "description": "I have a 3D modding application for Final Fantasy VII, and itâ€™s missing critical animation tools. The main things I think it's missing are a Gizmo to move and rotate joints in 3D space, animation splines to make adjustments to direction and speed, and a real animation bar at the bottom displaying your key frames and etc. It's also lacking automatic interpolation between the keys so you can play test the animation without manually adding additional frames, this makes it much harder if you need an animation\nto stay within a certain number of frames. The app has an animation retargeting feature, but it could probably be rounded out a bit more to work more like Maya or Unreal. If possible, it would be helpful to make the app platform agnostic so it can work on both Windows and Mac. If thatâ€™s too much reworking, then maybe just a Mac version as well. This isnâ€™t an absolute necessity, I currently use the app with Wine, but an app that can work natively would be much better. \n\nI didnâ€™t set a budget because Iâ€™m not sure what something like this would cost, and I didnâ€™t want to discourage anyone from applying. If youâ€™re interested let me know what you think, and how much you think you could complete this for. \n\nThe source code and application is here: \n\nhttps://github.com/LaZar00/KimeraCS\n",

        "description": "I have a 3D modding application for Final Fantasy VII, and itâ€™s missing critical animation tools. The main things I think it's missing are a Gizmo to move and rotate joints in 3D space, animation splines to make adjustments to direction and speed, and a real animation bar at the bottom displaying your key frames and etc. It's also lacking automatic interpolation between the keys so you can play test the animation without manually adding additional frames, this makes it much harder if you need an animation\nto stay within a certain number of frames. The app has an animation retargeting feature, but it could probably be rounded out a bit more to work more like Maya or Unreal. If possible, it would be helpful to make the app platform agnostic so it can work on both Windows and Mac. If thatâ€™s too much reworking, then maybe just a Mac version as well. This isnâ€™t an absolute necessity, I currently use the app with Wine, but an app that can work natively would be much better. \n\nI didnâ€™t set a budget because Iâ€™m not sure what something like this would cost, and I didnâ€™t want to discourage anyone from applying. If youâ€™re interested let me know what you think, and how much you think you could complete this for. \n\nThe source code and application is here: \n\nhttps://github.com/LaZar00/KimeraCS\n",

        "description": "GluCare was born out of the idea that a combination of a human-centric patient approach and a technology working together will lead to a better and more efficient management of diabetes and metabolic syndrome. \n\nThe GluCare team is looking to expand their successful business model from physical interaction to service in the cloud. This new offering will be called Zone.Health. The ask is to build a website that acts as the hub of information in order to get patients to join their program. The various sections of the site will consist of: \n\nâ€¢\tâ—  What is Zone.health? \nâ€¢\tâ—  The program \nâ€¢\tâ—  Why it works? \nâ€¢\tâ—  Join now \nâ€¢\tâ—  Pricing \nâ€¢\tâ—  FAQs \n\nWe envisage the website to have an onboarding portal which will consist of three parts, an API, a CMS and a Frontend system.\n\n1.\tThis will allow for future integration into other customer touch points should the need arise. The onboarding journey will consist of: \n\n1) BMI calculator\n\nIf less 27, show a message to say that they donâ€™t qualify. If greater 27, take the user through the registration flow. \n\n2) Registration (numerous inputs)\n\nOnce the patient has provided the above, they will be visible within the custom built CMS. The practitioner will have a login to the CMS whereby they will be able to view the information captured by the patient. They would be able to add specific notes after the consultation and select the medication and the required gear (glucose monitor, wearable and scale) to send to the patient. The idea is that the cost of these items will be built into the system, so that the practitioner can simply select the products, which then creates the payment link. This will be centrally managed in its totality in the CMS. \nOnce the payment has been made, the kit will be delivered to the patient and the engagement with Zone.Health will be through the app. However, each month, the practitioner will log into the CMS and create a payment link based on the progress the patient is making. \n\nAll invoices and orders will be available to the patient when logging into the site. It is important to note that the onboarding portal and the mobile app (this has been developed separately and not in the scope of this project) should use the same authentication system in order to prevent the patient having to create two seperate accounts. \nDetails will be provided once engagement starts, but we expect the website to consist of:\n\no\tâ—  Project set up \no\tâ—  Information website build \no\tâ—  BMI \no\tâ—  Registration \no\tâ—  Further screening questions \no\tâ—  Laboratory Test Uploads \no\tâ—  Schedule a visit \no\tâ—  Confirmation \no\tâ—  Payment Process \no\tâ—  Account Settings \no\tâ—  CMS - View users \no\tâ—  CMS - Create payments \no\tâ—  CMS - Shipment of your ZoneHealth kit notification \no\tâ—  Email Templates Creation \no\tâ—  Email Provider Integration \no\tâ—  CRM Integration \no\tâ—  Scheduling System Integration \no\tâ—  Payment Provider Integration \nVideo Conferencing Integration \n\nThere are similar businesses in the US and we like this the most: https://joinfound.com\n\n",

I would like a freelancer to propose a price for this work.  \n\nAt the site users log in with a username and password that I provide. The project to which they are assigned opens and user then adds one or more comments. There are multiple projects and multiple users so that login credentials ensures that the user accesses the correct project. I have admin rights on the site to set up projects, set up users, assign users to projects and download data collected. I need to make clear that I am not a website administrator, nor do I have deep skills in the technology. While I am tech savvy in a number of areas, and I have managed many tech development projects through Upwork and the predecessor companies. The freelancer will need to communicate with me at my level of understanding. \n\nThe site has not been used much recently and the code is now out of date. Most parts of the site seem to work ok except when a user logs in, their project does not open. I need a freelancer to review the code and update the site (patches, fixes, etc.). I do not need a redesign or new functionality; I only need the code updated. I do have more detailed documentation that I can share with freelancers that are shortlisted. The freelancer who created the site did great work but they are not available at this time so I need a new freelancer who can do this work. \n\nI have accounts on Heroku and Vercel to support this site and the below is a brief summary of the documentation from the freelancer that created the project.\nLIBRARIES &amp; FRAMEWORKS ON THE FRONT END\nReact JS - React is an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components.\nNext JS â€“ Was used to build server-side rendering and static web applications using React.\nStyled-Components â€“ This utilizes tagged template literals to style the components.\nMaterial-UI - React components for faster and easier web development.\nJs-Cookie â€“ Is a simple, lightweight JavaScript API for handling browser cookies, this was used to read the cookie token stored in the browser and was used for authenticating users as soon as they are signed in using the form on the application.\nIsormorphic-Fetch - Isomorphic-fetch is implementation of fetch for both Node.js and browser, this was used to communicate with the backend (server) and used to fetch data stored on the server database and pulled to the frontend.\nThe rest of the libraries/frameworks can be found in the package.json file on the root directory of the project. Any developer that will be doing further work on the project can find the documentation on the README.MD file on the GitHub page useful and straightforward.\n\nLIBRARIES &amp; FRAMEWORKS ON THE BACK END\nNode JS â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side.\nExpress JS â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side.\nMongoose â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code \nJson2cvs â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side.\n\n\n \n",

You will need moderate graphic design skills.\n\nWe will have a screen where we showcase the app features and another screen where we'll add informative blogs. That is all, it's not a big project.\n\nSEO knowledge is important, not because we'll try to push high on organic ranking but at least because we want to do something that does not go against the ranking algorithm.\n\nIf you have made any projects for mobile application landing pages, please do share. We'll look at each of them and it will have a big impact on our decision.\n\nThat's pretty much it, if I'm missing anything please ask. I'll respond as fast as I can.",

I would like a freelancer to propose a price for this work.  \n\nAt the site users log in with a username and password that I provide. The project to which they are assigned opens and user then adds one or more comments. There are multiple projects and multiple users so that login credentials ensures that the user accesses the correct project. I have admin rights on the site to set up projects, set up users, assign users to projects and download data collected. I need to make clear that I am not a website administrator, nor do I have deep skills in the technology. While I am tech savvy in a number of areas, and I have managed many tech development projects through Upwork and the predecessor companies. The freelancer will need to communicate with me at my level of understanding. \n\nThe site has not been used much recently and the code is now out of date. Most parts of the site seem to work ok except when a user logs in, their project does not open. I need a freelancer to review the code and update the site (patches, fixes, etc.). I do not need a redesign or new functionality; I only need the code updated. I do have more detailed documentation that I can share with freelancers that are shortlisted. The freelancer who created the site did great work but they are not available at this time so I need a new freelancer who can do this work. \n\nI have accounts on Heroku and Vercel to support this site and the below is a brief summary of the documentation from the freelancer that created the project.\nLIBRARIES &amp; FRAMEWORKS ON THE FRONT END\nReact JS - React is an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components.\nNext JS â€“ Was used to build server-side rendering and static web applications using React.\nStyled-Components â€“ This utilizes tagged template literals to style the components.\nMaterial-UI - React components for faster and easier web development.\nJs-Cookie â€“ Is a simple, lightweight JavaScript API for handling browser cookies, this was used to read the cookie token stored in the browser and was used for authenticating users as soon as they are signed in using the form on the application.\nIsormorphic-Fetch - Isomorphic-fetch is implementation of fetch for both Node.js and browser, this was used to communicate with the backend (server) and used to fetch data stored on the server database and pulled to the frontend.\nThe rest of the libraries/frameworks can be found in the package.json file on the root directory of the project. Any developer that will be doing further work on the project can find the documentation on the README.MD file on the GitHub page useful and straightforward.\n\nLIBRARIES &amp; FRAMEWORKS ON THE BACK END\nNode JS â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side.\nExpress JS â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side.\nMongoose â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code \nJson2cvs â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side.\n\n\n \n",

The project to which they are assigned opens and user then adds one or more comments. There are multiple projects and multiple users so that login credentials ensures that the user accesses the correct project.

I need to make clear that I am not a website administrator, nor do I have deep skills in the technology.

The freelancer who created the site did great work but they are not available at this time so I need a new freelancer who can do this work. \n\nI have accounts on Heroku and Vercel to support this site and the below is a brief summary of the documentation from the freelancer that created the project.\nLIBRARIES &amp; FRAMEWORKS ON THE FRONT END\nReact JS - React is an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components.\nNext JS â€“ Was used to build server-side rendering and static web applications using React.\nStyled-Components â€“ This utilizes tagged template literals to style the components.\nMaterial-UI - React components for faster and easier web development.\nJs-Cookie â€“ Is a simple, lightweight JavaScript API for handling browser cookies, this was used to read the cookie token stored in the browser and was used for authenticating users as soon as they are signed in using the form on the application.\nIsormorphic-Fetch - Isomorphic-fetch is implementation of fetch for both Node.js and browser, this was used to communicate with the backend (server) and used to fetch data stored on the server database and pulled to the frontend.\nThe rest of the libraries/frameworks can be found in the package.json file on the root directory of the project.

This new offering will be called Zone.Health. The ask is to build a website that acts as the hub of information in order to get patients to join their program. The various sections of the site will consist of: \n\nâ€¢\tâ—  What is Zone.health? \nâ€¢\tâ—  The program \nâ€¢\tâ—  Why it works? \nâ€¢\tâ—  Join now \nâ€¢\tâ—  Pricing \nâ€¢\tâ—  FAQs \n\nWe envisage the website to have an onboarding portal which will consist of three parts, an API, a CMS and a Frontend system.\n\n1.\tThis will allow for future integration into other customer touch points should the need arise. The onboarding journey will consist of: \n\n1) BMI calculator\n\nIf less 27, show a message to say that they donâ€™t qualify. If greater 27, take the user through the registration flow. \n\n2) Registration (numerous inputs)\n\nOnce the patient has provided the above, they will be visible within the custom built CMS. The practitioner will have a login to the CMS whereby they will be able to view the information captured by the patient. They would be able to add specific notes after the consultation and select the medication and the required gear (glucose monitor, wearable and scale) to send to the patient. The idea is that the cost of these items will be built into the system, so that the practitioner can simply select the products, which then creates the payment link. This will be centrally managed in its totality in the CMS. \nOnce the payment has been made, the kit will be delivered to the patient and the engagement with Zone.Health will be through the app. However, each month, the practitioner will log into the CMS and create a payment link based on the progress the patient is making. \n\nAll invoices and orders will be available to the patient when logging into the site. It is important to note that the onboarding portal and the mobile app (this has been developed separately and not in the scope of this project) should use the same authentication system in order to prevent the patient having to create two seperate accounts. \nDetails will be provided once engagement starts, but we expect the website to consist of:\n\no\tâ—  Project set up \no\tâ—  Information website build \no\tâ—  BMI \no\tâ—  Registration \no\tâ—  Further screening questions \no\tâ—  Laboratory Test Uploads \no\tâ—  Schedule a visit \no\tâ—  Confirmation \no\tâ—  Payment Process \no\tâ—  Account Settings \no\tâ—  CMS - View users \no\tâ—  CMS - Create payments \no\tâ—  CMS - Shipment of your ZoneHealth kit notification \no\tâ—  Email Templates Creation \no\tâ—  Email Provider Integration \no\tâ—  CRM Integration \no\tâ—  Scheduling System Integration \no\tâ—  Payment Provider Integration \nVideo Conferencing Integration \n\nThere are similar businesses in the US and we like this the most: https://joinfound.com\n\n",

The requirements are to create a Flow with the Flow Designer corresponding to a provided Visio Diagram.\nThe flow is triggered by a Catalog Item and has some if conditions that trigger on the selections the user does on previous tasks on the variables.\nFurther, there should be Notifications triggered by events at the right places in the Flow with dynamic variables included.\nAlso it is necessary to show specific variables on the Service Portal but hide them on the Ritm and task and also to make variables read only or mandatory depending on Service Portal / Ritm or Task level.\nSince the requirements are not set entirely a little bit creativity is needed. But the underlying focus is always that the Client is satisfied. \nWhen there are questions I can support and help with implementation questions or design.\n\nYou should also know how update sets work.\n\nThe Project takes about 40h And will end at mid September the latest.\n\nFeel free to apply,\nMax\n\n\n",

I would like a freelancer to propose a price for this work.  \n\nAt the site users log in with a username and password that I provide. The project to which they are assigned opens and user then adds one or more comments. There are multiple projects and multiple users so that login credentials ensures that the user accesses the correct project. I have admin rights on the site to set up projects, set up users, assign users to projects and download data collected. I need to make clear that I am not a website administrator, nor do I have deep skills in the technology. While I am tech savvy in a number of areas, and I have managed many tech development projects through Upwork and the predecessor companies. The freelancer will need to communicate with me at my level of understanding. \n\nThe site has not been used much recently and the code is now out of date. Most parts of the site seem to work ok except when a user logs in, their project does not open. I need a freelancer to review the code and update the site (patches, fixes, etc.). I do not need a redesign or new functionality; I only need the code updated. I do have more detailed documentation that I can share with freelancers that are shortlisted. The freelancer who created the site did great work but they are not available at this time so I need a new freelancer who can do this work. \n\nI have accounts on Heroku and Vercel to support this site and the below is a brief summary of the documentation from the freelancer that created the project.\nLIBRARIES &amp; FRAMEWORKS ON THE FRONT END\nReact JS - React is an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components.\nNext JS â€“ Was used to build server-side rendering and static web applications using React.\nStyled-Components â€“ This utilizes tagged template literals to style the components.\nMaterial-UI - React components for faster and easier web development.\nJs-Cookie â€“ Is a simple, lightweight JavaScript API for handling browser cookies, this was used to read the cookie token stored in the browser and was used for authenticating users as soon as they are signed in using the form on the application.\nIsormorphic-Fetch - Isomorphic-fetch is implementation of fetch for both Node.js and browser, this was used to communicate with the backend (server) and used to fetch data stored on the server database and pulled to the frontend.\nThe rest of the libraries/frameworks can be found in the package.json file on the root directory of the project. Any developer that will be doing further work on the project can find the documentation on the README.MD file on the GitHub page useful and straightforward.\n\nLIBRARIES &amp; FRAMEWORKS ON THE BACK END\nNode JS â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side.\nExpress JS â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side.\nMongoose â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code \nJson2cvs â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side.\n\n\n \n",

        "description": "GluCare was born out of the idea that a combination of a human-centric patient approach and a technology working together will lead to a better and more efficient management of diabetes and metabolic syndrome. \n\nThe GluCare team is looking to expand their successful business model from physical interaction to service in the cloud. This new offering will be called Zone.Health. The ask is to build a website that acts as the hub of information in order to get patients to join their program. The various sections of the site will consist of: \n\nâ€¢\tâ—  What is Zone.health? \nâ€¢\tâ—  The program \nâ€¢\tâ—  Why it works? \nâ€¢\tâ—  Join now \nâ€¢\tâ—  Pricing \nâ€¢\tâ—  FAQs \n\nWe envisage the website to have an onboarding portal which will consist of three parts, an API, a CMS and a Frontend system.\n\n1.\tThis will allow for future integration into other customer touch points should the need arise. The onboarding journey will consist of: \n\n1) BMI calculator\n\nIf less 27, show a message to say that they donâ€™t qualify. If greater 27, take the user through the registration flow. \n\n2) Registration (numerous inputs)\n\nOnce the patient has provided the above, they will be visible within the custom built CMS. The practitioner will have a login to the CMS whereby they will be able to view the information captured by the patient. They would be able to add specific notes after the consultation and select the medication and the required gear (glucose monitor, wearable and scale) to send to the patient. The idea is that the cost of these items will be built into the system, so that the practitioner can simply select the products, which then creates the payment link. This will be centrally managed in its totality in the CMS. \nOnce the payment has been made, the kit will be delivered to the patient and the engagement with Zone.Health will be through the app. However, each month, the practitioner will log into the CMS and create a payment link based on the progress the patient is making. \n\nAll invoices and orders will be available to the patient when logging into the site. It is important to note that the onboarding portal and the mobile app (this has been developed separately and not in the scope of this project) should use the same authentication system in order to prevent the patient having to create two seperate accounts. \nDetails will be provided once engagement starts, but we expect the website to consist of:\n\no\tâ—  Project set up \no\tâ—  Information website build \no\tâ—  BMI \no\tâ—  Registration \no\tâ—  Further screening questions \no\tâ—  Laboratory Test Uploads \no\tâ—  Schedule a visit \no\tâ—  Confirmation \no\tâ—  Payment Process \no\tâ—  Account Settings \no\tâ—  CMS - View users \no\tâ—  CMS - Create payments \no\tâ—  CMS - Shipment of your ZoneHealth kit notification \no\tâ—  Email Templates Creation \no\tâ—  Email Provider Integration \no\tâ—  CRM Integration \no\tâ—  Scheduling System Integration \no\tâ—  Payment Provider Integration \nVideo Conferencing Integration \n\nThere are similar businesses in the US and we like this the most: https://joinfound.com\n\n",

        "description": "I have an interactive website that needs to be updated. The purpose of the site is to collect comments from users who are directed to the site. I would like a freelancer to propose a price for this work.  \n\nAt the site users log in with a username and password that I provide. The project to which they are assigned opens and user then adds one or more comments. There are multiple projects and multiple users so that login credentials ensures that the user accesses the correct project. I have admin rights on the site to set up projects, set up users, assign users to projects and download data collected. I need to make clear that I am not a website administrator, nor do I have deep skills in the technology. While I am tech savvy in a number of areas, and I have managed many tech development projects through Upwork and the predecessor companies. The freelancer will need to communicate with me at my level of understanding. \n\nThe site has not been used much recently and the code is now out of date. Most parts of the site seem to work ok except when a user logs in, their project does not open. I need a freelancer to review the code and update the site (patches, fixes, etc.). I do not need a redesign or new functionality; I only need the code updated. I do have more detailed documentation that I can share with freelancers that are shortlisted. The freelancer who created the site did great work but they are not available at this time so I need a new freelancer who can do this work. \n\nI have accounts on Heroku and Vercel to support this site and the below is a brief summary of the documentation from the freelancer that created the project.\nLIBRARIES &amp; FRAMEWORKS ON THE FRONT END\nReact JS - React is an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components.\nNext JS â€“ Was used to build server-side rendering and static web applications using React.\nStyled-Components â€“ This utilizes tagged template literals to style the components.\nMaterial-UI - React components for faster and easier web development.\nJs-Cookie â€“ Is a simple, lightweight JavaScript API for handling browser cookies, this was used to read the cookie token stored in the browser and was used for authenticating users as soon as they are signed in using the form on the application.\nIsormorphic-Fetch - Isomorphic-fetch is implementation of fetch for both Node.js and browser, this was used to communicate with the backend (server) and used to fetch data stored on the server database and pulled to the frontend.\nThe rest of the libraries/frameworks can be found in the package.json file on the root directory of the project. Any developer that will be doing further work on the project can find the documentation on the README.MD file on the GitHub page useful and straightforward.\n\nLIBRARIES &amp; FRAMEWORKS ON THE BACK END\nNode JS â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side.\nExpress JS â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side.\nMongoose â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code \nJson2cvs â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side.\n\n\n \n",

        "description": "GluCare was born out of the idea that a combination of a human-centric patient approach and a technology working together will lead to a better and more efficient management of diabetes and metabolic syndrome. \n\nThe GluCare team is looking to expand their successful business model from physical interaction to service in the cloud. This new offering will be called Zone.Health. The ask is to build a website that acts as the hub of information in order to get patients to join their program. The various sections of the site will consist of: \n\nâ€¢\tâ—  What is Zone.health? \nâ€¢\tâ—  The program \nâ€¢\tâ—  Why it works? \nâ€¢\tâ—  Join now \nâ€¢\tâ—  Pricing \nâ€¢\tâ—  FAQs \n\nWe envisage the website to have an onboarding portal which will consist of three parts, an API, a CMS and a Frontend system.\n\n1.\tThis will allow for future integration into other customer touch points should the need arise. The onboarding journey will consist of: \n\n1) BMI calculator\n\nIf less 27, show a message to say that they donâ€™t qualify. If greater 27, take the user through the registration flow. \n\n2) Registration (numerous inputs)\n\nOnce the patient has provided the above, they will be visible within the custom built CMS. The practitioner will have a login to the CMS whereby they will be able to view the information captured by the patient. They would be able to add specific notes after the consultation and select the medication and the required gear (glucose monitor, wearable and scale) to send to the patient. The idea is that the cost of these items will be built into the system, so that the practitioner can simply select the products, which then creates the payment link. This will be centrally managed in its totality in the CMS. \nOnce the payment has been made, the kit will be delivered to the patient and the engagement with Zone.Health will be through the app. However, each month, the practitioner will log into the CMS and create a payment link based on the progress the patient is making. \n\nAll invoices and orders will be available to the patient when logging into the site. It is important to note that the onboarding portal and the mobile app (this has been developed separately and not in the scope of this project) should use the same authentication system in order to prevent the patient having to create two seperate accounts. \nDetails will be provided once engagement starts, but we expect the website to consist of:\n\no\tâ—  Project set up \no\tâ—  Information website build \no\tâ—  BMI \no\tâ—  Registration \no\tâ—  Further screening questions \no\tâ—  Laboratory Test Uploads \no\tâ—  Schedule a visit \no\tâ—  Confirmation \no\tâ—  Payment Process \no\tâ—  Account Settings \no\tâ—  CMS - View users \no\tâ—  CMS - Create payments \no\tâ—  CMS - Shipment of your ZoneHealth kit notification \no\tâ—  Email Templates Creation \no\tâ—  Email Provider Integration \no\tâ—  CRM Integration \no\tâ—  Scheduling System Integration \no\tâ—  Payment Provider Integration \nVideo Conferencing Integration \n\nThere are similar businesses in the US and we like this the most: https://joinfound.com\n\n",

        "description": "I have a 3D modding application for Final Fantasy VII, and itâ€™s missing critical animation tools. The main things I think it's missing are a Gizmo to move and rotate joints in 3D space, animation splines to make adjustments to direction and speed, and a real animation bar at the bottom displaying your key frames and etc. It's also lacking automatic interpolation between the keys so you can play test the animation without manually adding additional frames, this makes it much harder if you need an animation\nto stay within a certain number of frames. The app has an animation retargeting feature, but it could probably be rounded out a bit more to work more like Maya or Unreal. If possible, it would be helpful to make the app platform agnostic so it can work on both Windows and Mac. If thatâ€™s too much reworking, then maybe just a Mac version as well. This isnâ€™t an absolute necessity, I currently use the app with Wine, but an app that can work natively would be much better. \n\nI didnâ€™t set a budget because Iâ€™m not sure what something like this would cost, and I didnâ€™t want to discourage anyone from applying. If youâ€™re interested let me know what you think, and how much you think you could complete this for. \n\nThe source code and application is here: \n\nhttps://github.com/LaZar00/KimeraCS\n",

The requirements are to create a Flow with the Flow Designer corresponding to a provided Visio Diagram.\nThe flow is triggered by a Catalog Item and has some if conditions that trigger on the selections the user does on previous tasks on the variables.\nFurther, there should be Notifications triggered by events at the right places in the Flow with dynamic variables included.\nAlso it is necessary to show specific variables on the Service Portal but hide them on the Ritm and task and also to make variables read only or mandatory depending on Service Portal / Ritm or Task level.\nSince the requirements are not set entirely a little bit creativity is needed. But the underlying focus is always that the Client is satisfied. \nWhen there are questions I can support and help with implementation questions or design.\n\nYou should also know how update sets work.\n\nThe Project takes about 40h And will end at mid September the latest.\n\nFeel free to apply,\nMax\n\n\n",

        "description": "GluCare was born out of the idea that a combination of a human-centric patient approach and a technology working together will lead to a better and more efficient management of diabetes and metabolic syndrome. \n\nThe GluCare team is looking to expand their successful business model from physical interaction to service in the cloud. This new offering will be called Zone.Health. The ask is to build a website that acts as the hub of information in order to get patients to join their program. The various sections of the site will consist of: \n\nâ€¢\tâ—  What is Zone.health? \nâ€¢\tâ—  The program \nâ€¢\tâ—  Why it works? \nâ€¢\tâ—  Join now \nâ€¢\tâ—  Pricing \nâ€¢\tâ—  FAQs \n\nWe envisage the website to have an onboarding portal which will consist of three parts, an API, a CMS and a Frontend system.\n\n1.\tThis will allow for future integration into other customer touch points should the need arise. The onboarding journey will consist of: \n\n1) BMI calculator\n\nIf less 27, show a message to say that they donâ€™t qualify. If greater 27, take the user through the registration flow. \n\n2) Registration (numerous inputs)\n\nOnce the patient has provided the above, they will be visible within the custom built CMS. The practitioner will have a login to the CMS whereby they will be able to view the information captured by the patient. They would be able to add specific notes after the consultation and select the medication and the required gear (glucose monitor, wearable and scale) to send to the patient. The idea is that the cost of these items will be built into the system, so that the practitioner can simply select the products, which then creates the payment link. This will be centrally managed in its totality in the CMS. \nOnce the payment has been made, the kit will be delivered to the patient and the engagement with Zone.Health will be through the app. However, each month, the practitioner will log into the CMS and create a payment link based on the progress the patient is making. \n\nAll invoices and orders will be available to the patient when logging into the site. It is important to note that the onboarding portal and the mobile app (this has been developed separately and not in the scope of this project) should use the same authentication system in order to prevent the patient having to create two seperate accounts. \nDetails will be provided once engagement starts, but we expect the website to consist of:\n\no\tâ—  Project set up \no\tâ—  Information website build \no\tâ—  BMI \no\tâ—  Registration \no\tâ—  Further screening questions \no\tâ—  Laboratory Test Uploads \no\tâ—  Schedule a visit \no\tâ—  Confirmation \no\tâ—  Payment Process \no\tâ—  Account Settings \no\tâ—  CMS - View users \no\tâ—  CMS - Create payments \no\tâ—  CMS - Shipment of your ZoneHealth kit notification \no\tâ—  Email Templates Creation \no\tâ—  Email Provider Integration \no\tâ—  CRM Integration \no\tâ—  Scheduling System Integration \no\tâ—  Payment Provider Integration \nVideo Conferencing Integration \n\nThere are similar businesses in the US and we like this the most: https://joinfound.com\n\n",

I would like a freelancer to propose a price for this work.  \n\nAt the site users log in with a username and password that I provide. The project to which they are assigned opens and user then adds one or more comments. There are multiple projects and multiple users so that login credentials ensures that the user accesses the correct project. I have admin rights on the site to set up projects, set up users, assign users to projects and download data collected. I need to make clear that I am not a website administrator, nor do I have deep skills in the technology. While I am tech savvy in a number of areas, and I have managed many tech development projects through Upwork and the predecessor companies. The freelancer will need to communicate with me at my level of understanding. \n\nThe site has not been used much recently and the code is now out of date. Most parts of the site seem to work ok except when a user logs in, their project does not open. I need a freelancer to review the code and update the site (patches, fixes, etc.). I do not need a redesign or new functionality; I only need the code updated. I do have more detailed documentation that I can share with freelancers that are shortlisted. The freelancer who created the site did great work but they are not available at this time so I need a new freelancer who can do this work. \n\nI have accounts on Heroku and Vercel to support this site and the below is a brief summary of the documentation from the freelancer that created the project.\nLIBRARIES &amp; FRAMEWORKS ON THE FRONT END\nReact JS - React is an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components.\nNext JS â€“ Was used to build server-side rendering and static web applications using React.\nStyled-Components â€“ This utilizes tagged template literals to style the components.\nMaterial-UI - React components for faster and easier web development.\nJs-Cookie â€“ Is a simple, lightweight JavaScript API for handling browser cookies, this was used to read the cookie token stored in the browser and was used for authenticating users as soon as they are signed in using the form on the application.\nIsormorphic-Fetch - Isomorphic-fetch is implementation of fetch for both Node.js and browser, this was used to communicate with the backend (server) and used to fetch data stored on the server database and pulled to the frontend.\nThe rest of the libraries/frameworks can be found in the package.json file on the root directory of the project. Any developer that will be doing further work on the project can find the documentation on the README.MD file on the GitHub page useful and straightforward.\n\nLIBRARIES &amp; FRAMEWORKS ON THE BACK END\nNode JS â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side.\nExpress JS â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side.\nMongoose â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code \nJson2cvs â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side.\n\n\n \n",

        "description": "I have a 3D modding application for Final Fantasy VII, and itâ€™s missing critical animation tools. The main things I think it's missing are a Gizmo to move and rotate joints in 3D space, animation splines to make adjustments to direction and speed, and a real animation bar at the bottom displaying your key frames and etc. It's also lacking automatic interpolation between the keys so you can play test the animation without manually adding additional frames, this makes it much harder if you need an animation\nto stay within a certain number of frames. The app has an animation retargeting feature, but it could probably be rounded out a bit more to work more like Maya or Unreal. If possible, it would be helpful to make the app platform agnostic so it can work on both Windows and Mac. If thatâ€™s too much reworking, then maybe just a Mac version as well. This isnâ€™t an absolute necessity, I currently use the app with Wine, but an app that can work natively would be much better. \n\nI didnâ€™t set a budget because Iâ€™m not sure what something like this would cost, and I didnâ€™t want to discourage anyone from applying. If youâ€™re interested let me know what you think, and how much you think you could complete this for. \n\nThe source code and application is here: \n\nhttps://github.com/LaZar00/KimeraCS\n",

Our current website is ugly and not worth the paid advertisement. \n\nWe are looking for customization. We do not expect you to create art from scratch, but we definitely need a website that looks like our own. You will need moderate graphic design skills.\n\nWe will have a screen where we showcase the app features and another screen where we'll add informative blogs. That is all, it's not a big project.\n\nSEO knowledge is important, not because we'll try to push high on organic ranking but at least because we want to do something that does not go against the ranking algorithm.\n\nIf you have made any projects for mobile application landing pages, please do share. We'll look at each of them and it will have a big impact on our decision.\n\nThat's pretty much it, if I'm missing anything please ask. I'll respond as fast as I can.",

This new offering will be called Zone.Health. The ask is to build a website that acts as the hub of information in order to get patients to join their program. The various sections of the site will consist of: \n\nâ€¢\tâ—  What is Zone.health? \nâ€¢\tâ—  The program \nâ€¢\tâ—  Why it works? \nâ€¢\tâ—  Join now \nâ€¢\tâ—  Pricing \nâ€¢\tâ—  FAQs \n\nWe envisage the website to have an onboarding portal which will consist of three parts, an API, a CMS and a Frontend system.\n\n1.\tThis will allow for future integration into other customer touch points should the need arise. The onboarding journey will consist of: \n\n1) BMI calculator\n\nIf less 27, show a message to say that they donâ€™t qualify. If greater 27, take the user through the registration flow. \n\n2) Registration (numerous inputs)\n\nOnce the patient has provided the above, they will be visible within the custom built CMS. The practitioner will have a login to the CMS whereby they will be able to view the information captured by the patient. They would be able to add specific notes after the consultation and select the medication and the required gear (glucose monitor, wearable and scale) to send to the patient. The idea is that the cost of these items will be built into the system, so that the practitioner can simply select the products, which then creates the payment link. This will be centrally managed in its totality in the CMS. \nOnce the payment has been made, the kit will be delivered to the patient and the engagement with Zone.Health will be through the app. However, each month, the practitioner will log into the CMS and create a payment link based on the progress the patient is making. \n\nAll invoices and orders will be available to the patient when logging into the site. It is important to note that the onboarding portal and the mobile app (this has been developed separately and not in the scope of this project) should use the same authentication system in order to prevent the patient having to create two seperate accounts. \nDetails will be provided once engagement starts, but we expect the website to consist of:\n\no\tâ—  Project set up \no\tâ—  Information website build \no\tâ—  BMI \no\tâ—  Registration \no\tâ—  Further screening questions \no\tâ—  Laboratory Test Uploads \no\tâ—  Schedule a visit \no\tâ—  Confirmation \no\tâ—  Payment Process \no\tâ—  Account Settings \no\tâ—  CMS - View users \no\tâ—  CMS - Create payments \no\tâ—  CMS - Shipment of your ZoneHealth kit notification \no\tâ—  Email Templates Creation \no\tâ—  Email Provider Integration \no\tâ—  CRM Integration \no\tâ—  Scheduling System Integration \no\tâ—  Payment Provider Integration \nVideo Conferencing Integration \n\nThere are similar businesses in the US and we like this the most: https://joinfound.com\n\n",

        "description": "I have a 3D modding application for Final Fantasy VII, and itâ€™s missing critical animation tools. The main things I think it's missing are a Gizmo to move and rotate joints in 3D space, animation splines to make adjustments to direction and speed, and a real animation bar at the bottom displaying your key frames and etc. It's also lacking automatic interpolation between the keys so you can play test the animation without manually adding additional frames, this makes it much harder if you need an animation\nto stay within a certain number of frames. The app has an animation retargeting feature, but it could probably be rounded out a bit more to work more like Maya or Unreal. If possible, it would be helpful to make the app platform agnostic so it can work on both Windows and Mac. If thatâ€™s too much reworking, then maybe just a Mac version as well. This isnâ€™t an absolute necessity, I currently use the app with Wine, but an app that can work natively would be much better. \n\nI didnâ€™t set a budget because Iâ€™m not sure what something like this would cost, and I didnâ€™t want to discourage anyone from applying. If youâ€™re interested let me know what you think, and how much you think you could complete this for. \n\nThe source code and application is here: \n\nhttps://github.com/LaZar00/KimeraCS\n",

I would like a freelancer to propose a price for this work.  \n\nAt the site users log in with a username and password that I provide. The project to which they are assigned opens and user then adds one or more comments. There are multiple projects and multiple users so that login credentials ensures that the user accesses the correct project. I have admin rights on the site to set up projects, set up users, assign users to projects and download data collected. I need to make clear that I am not a website administrator, nor do I have deep skills in the technology. While I am tech savvy in a number of areas, and I have managed many tech development projects through Upwork and the predecessor companies. The freelancer will need to communicate with me at my level of understanding. \n\nThe site has not been used much recently and the code is now out of date. Most parts of the site seem to work ok except when a user logs in, their project does not open. I need a freelancer to review the code and update the site (patches, fixes, etc.). I do not need a redesign or new functionality; I only need the code updated. I do have more detailed documentation that I can share with freelancers that are shortlisted. The freelancer who created the site did great work but they are not available at this time so I need a new freelancer who can do this work. \n\nI have accounts on Heroku and Vercel to support this site and the below is a brief summary of the documentation from the freelancer that created the project.\nLIBRARIES &amp; FRAMEWORKS ON THE FRONT END\nReact JS - React is an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components.\nNext JS â€“ Was used to build server-side rendering and static web applications using React.\nStyled-Components â€“ This utilizes tagged template literals to style the components.\nMaterial-UI - React components for faster and easier web development.\nJs-Cookie â€“ Is a simple, lightweight JavaScript API for handling browser cookies, this was used to read the cookie token stored in the browser and was used for authenticating users as soon as they are signed in using the form on the application.\nIsormorphic-Fetch - Isomorphic-fetch is implementation of fetch for both Node.js and browser, this was used to communicate with the backend (server) and used to fetch data stored on the server database and pulled to the frontend.\nThe rest of the libraries/frameworks can be found in the package.json file on the root directory of the project. Any developer that will be doing further work on the project can find the documentation on the README.MD file on the GitHub page useful and straightforward.\n\nLIBRARIES &amp; FRAMEWORKS ON THE BACK END\nNode JS â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side.\nExpress JS â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side.\nMongoose â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code \nJson2cvs â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side.\n\n\n \n",

        "description": "I have an interactive website that needs to be updated. The purpose of the site is to collect comments from users who are directed to the site. I would like a freelancer to propose a price for this work.  \n\nAt the site users log in with a username and password that I provide. The project to which they are assigned opens and user then adds one or more comments. There are multiple projects and multiple users so that login credentials ensures that the user accesses the correct project. I have admin rights on the site to set up projects, set up users, assign users to projects and download data collected. I need to make clear that I am not a website administrator, nor do I have deep skills in the technology. While I am tech savvy in a number of areas, and I have managed many tech development projects through Upwork and the predecessor companies. The freelancer will need to communicate with me at my level of understanding. \n\nThe site has not been used much recently and the code is now out of date. Most parts of the site seem to work ok except when a user logs in, their project does not open. I need a freelancer to review the code and update the site (patches, fixes, etc.). I do not need a redesign or new functionality; I only need the code updated. I do have more detailed documentation that I can share with freelancers that are shortlisted. The freelancer who created the site did great work but they are not available at this time so I need a new freelancer who can do this work. \n\nI have accounts on Heroku and Vercel to support this site and the below is a brief summary of the documentation from the freelancer that created the project.\nLIBRARIES &amp; FRAMEWORKS ON THE FRONT END\nReact JS - React is an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components.\nNext JS â€“ Was used to build server-side rendering and static web applications using React.\nStyled-Components â€“ This utilizes tagged template literals to style the components.\nMaterial-UI - React components for faster and easier web development.\nJs-Cookie â€“ Is a simple, lightweight JavaScript API for handling browser cookies, this was used to read the cookie token stored in the browser and was used for authenticating users as soon as they are signed in using the form on the application.\nIsormorphic-Fetch - Isomorphic-fetch is implementation of fetch for both Node.js and browser, this was used to communicate with the backend (server) and used to fetch data stored on the server database and pulled to the frontend.\nThe rest of the libraries/frameworks can be found in the package.json file on the root directory of the project. Any developer that will be doing further work on the project can find the documentation on the README.MD file on the GitHub page useful and straightforward.\n\nLIBRARIES &amp; FRAMEWORKS ON THE BACK END\nNode JS â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side.\nExpress JS â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side.\nMongoose â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code \nJson2cvs â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side.\n\n\n \n",

        "description": "GluCare was born out of the idea that a combination of a human-centric patient approach and a technology working together will lead to a better and more efficient management of diabetes and metabolic syndrome. \n\nThe GluCare team is looking to expand their successful business model from physical interaction to service in the cloud. This new offering will be called Zone.Health. The ask is to build a website that acts as the hub of information in order to get patients to join their program. The various sections of the site will consist of: \n\nâ€¢\tâ—  What is Zone.health? \nâ€¢\tâ—  The program \nâ€¢\tâ—  Why it works? \nâ€¢\tâ—  Join now \nâ€¢\tâ—  Pricing \nâ€¢\tâ—  FAQs \n\nWe envisage the website to have an onboarding portal which will consist of three parts, an API, a CMS and a Frontend system.\n\n1.\tThis will allow for future integration into other customer touch points should the need arise. The onboarding journey will consist of: \n\n1) BMI calculator\n\nIf less 27, show a message to say that they donâ€™t qualify. If greater 27, take the user through the registration flow. \n\n2) Registration (numerous inputs)\n\nOnce the patient has provided the above, they will be visible within the custom built CMS. The practitioner will have a login to the CMS whereby they will be able to view the information captured by the patient. They would be able to add specific notes after the consultation and select the medication and the required gear (glucose monitor, wearable and scale) to send to the patient. The idea is that the cost of these items will be built into the system, so that the practitioner can simply select the products, which then creates the payment link. This will be centrally managed in its totality in the CMS. \nOnce the payment has been made, the kit will be delivered to the patient and the engagement with Zone.Health will be through the app. However, each month, the practitioner will log into the CMS and create a payment link based on the progress the patient is making. \n\nAll invoices and orders will be available to the patient when logging into the site. It is important to note that the onboarding portal and the mobile app (this has been developed separately and not in the scope of this project) should use the same authentication system in order to prevent the patient having to create two seperate accounts. \nDetails will be provided once engagement starts, but we expect the website to consist of:\n\no\tâ—  Project set up \no\tâ—  Information website build \no\tâ—  BMI \no\tâ—  Registration \no\tâ—  Further screening questions \no\tâ—  Laboratory Test Uploads \no\tâ—  Schedule a visit \no\tâ—  Confirmation \no\tâ—  Payment Process \no\tâ—  Account Settings \no\tâ—  CMS - View users \no\tâ—  CMS - Create payments \no\tâ—  CMS - Shipment of your ZoneHealth kit notification \no\tâ—  Email Templates Creation \no\tâ—  Email Provider Integration \no\tâ—  CRM Integration \no\tâ—  Scheduling System Integration \no\tâ—  Payment Provider Integration \nVideo Conferencing Integration \n\nThere are similar businesses in the US and we like this the most: https://joinfound.com\n\n",

        "description": "GluCare was born out of the idea that a combination of a human-centric patient approach and a technology working together will lead to a better and more efficient management of diabetes and metabolic syndrome. \n\nThe GluCare team is looking to expand their successful business model from physical interaction to service in the cloud. This new offering will be called Zone.Health. The ask is to build a website that acts as the hub of information in order to get patients to join their program. The various sections of the site will consist of: \n\nâ€¢\tâ—  What is Zone.health? \nâ€¢\tâ—  The program \nâ€¢\tâ—  Why it works? \nâ€¢\tâ—  Join now \nâ€¢\tâ—  Pricing \nâ€¢\tâ—  FAQs \n\nWe envisage the website to have an onboarding portal which will consist of three parts, an API, a CMS and a Frontend system.\n\n1.\tThis will allow for future integration into other customer touch points should the need arise. The onboarding journey will consist of: \n\n1) BMI calculator\n\nIf less 27, show a message to say that they donâ€™t qualify. If greater 27, take the user through the registration flow. \n\n2) Registration (numerous inputs)\n\nOnce the patient has provided the above, they will be visible within the custom built CMS. The practitioner will have a login to the CMS whereby they will be able to view the information captured by the patient. They would be able to add specific notes after the consultation and select the medication and the required gear (glucose monitor, wearable and scale) to send to the patient. The idea is that the cost of these items will be built into the system, so that the practitioner can simply select the products, which then creates the payment link. This will be centrally managed in its totality in the CMS. \nOnce the payment has been made, the kit will be delivered to the patient and the engagement with Zone.Health will be through the app. However, each month, the practitioner will log into the CMS and create a payment link based on the progress the patient is making. \n\nAll invoices and orders will be available to the patient when logging into the site. It is important to note that the onboarding portal and the mobile app (this has been developed separately and not in the scope of this project) should use the same authentication system in order to prevent the patient having to create two seperate accounts. \nDetails will be provided once engagement starts, but we expect the website to consist of:\n\no\tâ—  Project set up \no\tâ—  Information website build \no\tâ—  BMI \no\tâ—  Registration \no\tâ—  Further screening questions \no\tâ—  Laboratory Test Uploads \no\tâ—  Schedule a visit \no\tâ—  Confirmation \no\tâ—  Payment Process \no\tâ—  Account Settings \no\tâ—  CMS - View users \no\tâ—  CMS - Create payments \no\tâ—  CMS - Shipment of your ZoneHealth kit notification \no\tâ—  Email Templates Creation \no\tâ—  Email Provider Integration \no\tâ—  CRM Integration \no\tâ—  Scheduling System Integration \no\tâ—  Payment Provider Integration \nVideo Conferencing Integration \n\nThere are similar businesses in the US and we like this the most: https://joinfound.com\n\n",

        "description": "I have a 3D modding application for Final Fantasy VII, and itâ€™s missing critical animation tools. The main things I think it's missing are a Gizmo to move and rotate joints in 3D space, animation splines to make adjustments to direction and speed, and a real animation bar at the bottom displaying your key frames and etc. It's also lacking automatic interpolation between the keys so you can play test the animation without manually adding additional frames, this makes it much harder if you need an animation\nto stay within a certain number of frames. The app has an animation retargeting feature, but it could probably be rounded out a bit more to work more like Maya or Unreal. If possible, it would be helpful to make the app platform agnostic so it can work on both Windows and Mac. If thatâ€™s too much reworking, then maybe just a Mac version as well. This isnâ€™t an absolute necessity, I currently use the app with Wine, but an app that can work natively would be much better. \n\nI didnâ€™t set a budget because Iâ€™m not sure what something like this would cost, and I didnâ€™t want to discourage anyone from applying. If youâ€™re interested let me know what you think, and how much you think you could complete this for. \n\nThe source code and application is here: \n\nhttps://github.com/LaZar00/KimeraCS\n",

Our current website is ugly and not worth the paid advertisement. \n\nWe are looking for customization. We do not expect you to create art from scratch, but we definitely need a website that looks like our own. You will need moderate graphic design skills.\n\nWe will have a screen where we showcase the app features and another screen where we'll add informative blogs. That is all, it's not a big project.\n\nSEO knowledge is important, not because we'll try to push high on organic ranking but at least because we want to do something that does not go against the ranking algorithm.\n\nIf you have made any projects for mobile application landing pages, please do share. We'll look at each of them and it will have a big impact on our decision.\n\nThat's pretty much it, if I'm missing anything please ask. I'll respond as fast as I can.",

        "description": "GluCare was born out of the idea that a combination of a human-centric patient approach and a technology working together will lead to a better and more efficient management of diabetes and metabolic syndrome. \n\nThe GluCare team is looking to expand their successful business model from physical interaction to service in the cloud. This new offering will be called Zone.Health. The ask is to build a website that acts as the hub of information in order to get patients to join their program. The various sections of the site will consist of: \n\nâ€¢\tâ—  What is Zone.health? \nâ€¢\tâ—  The program \nâ€¢\tâ—  Why it works? \nâ€¢\tâ—  Join now \nâ€¢\tâ—  Pricing \nâ€¢\tâ—  FAQs \n\nWe envisage the website to have an onboarding portal which will consist of three parts, an API, a CMS and a Frontend system.\n\n1.\tThis will allow for future integration into other customer touch points should the need arise. The onboarding journey will consist of: \n\n1) BMI calculator\n\nIf less 27, show a message to say that they donâ€™t qualify. If greater 27, take the user through the registration flow. \n\n2) Registration (numerous inputs)\n\nOnce the patient has provided the above, they will be visible within the custom built CMS. The practitioner will have a login to the CMS whereby they will be able to view the information captured by the patient. They would be able to add specific notes after the consultation and select the medication and the required gear (glucose monitor, wearable and scale) to send to the patient. The idea is that the cost of these items will be built into the system, so that the practitioner can simply select the products, which then creates the payment link. This will be centrally managed in its totality in the CMS. \nOnce the payment has been made, the kit will be delivered to the patient and the engagement with Zone.Health will be through the app. However, each month, the practitioner will log into the CMS and create a payment link based on the progress the patient is making. \n\nAll invoices and orders will be available to the patient when logging into the site. It is important to note that the onboarding portal and the mobile app (this has been developed separately and not in the scope of this project) should use the same authentication system in order to prevent the patient having to create two seperate accounts. \nDetails will be provided once engagement starts, but we expect the website to consist of:\n\no\tâ—  Project set up \no\tâ—  Information website build \no\tâ—  BMI \no\tâ—  Registration \no\tâ—  Further screening questions \no\tâ—  Laboratory Test Uploads \no\tâ—  Schedule a visit \no\tâ—  Confirmation \no\tâ—  Payment Process \no\tâ—  Account Settings \no\tâ—  CMS - View users \no\tâ—  CMS - Create payments \no\tâ—  CMS - Shipment of your ZoneHealth kit notification \no\tâ—  Email Templates Creation \no\tâ—  Email Provider Integration \no\tâ—  CRM Integration \no\tâ—  Scheduling System Integration \no\tâ—  Payment Provider Integration \nVideo Conferencing Integration \n\nThere are similar businesses in the US and we like this the most: https://joinfound.com\n\n",

I would like a freelancer to propose a price for this work.  \n\nAt the site users log in with a username and password that I provide. The project to which they are assigned opens and user then adds one or more comments. There are multiple projects and multiple users so that login credentials ensures that the user accesses the correct project. I have admin rights on the site to set up projects, set up users, assign users to projects and download data collected. I need to make clear that I am not a website administrator, nor do I have deep skills in the technology. While I am tech savvy in a number of areas, and I have managed many tech development projects through Upwork and the predecessor companies. The freelancer will need to communicate with me at my level of understanding. \n\nThe site has not been used much recently and the code is now out of date. Most parts of the site seem to work ok except when a user logs in, their project does not open. I need a freelancer to review the code and update the site (patches, fixes, etc.). I do not need a redesign or new functionality; I only need the code updated. I do have more detailed documentation that I can share with freelancers that are shortlisted. The freelancer who created the site did great work but they are not available at this time so I need a new freelancer who can do this work. \n\nI have accounts on Heroku and Vercel to support this site and the below is a brief summary of the documentation from the freelancer that created the project.\nLIBRARIES &amp; FRAMEWORKS ON THE FRONT END\nReact JS - React is an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components.\nNext JS â€“ Was used to build server-side rendering and static web applications using React.\nStyled-Components â€“ This utilizes tagged template literals to style the components.\nMaterial-UI - React components for faster and easier web development.\nJs-Cookie â€“ Is a simple, lightweight JavaScript API for handling browser cookies, this was used to read the cookie token stored in the browser and was used for authenticating users as soon as they are signed in using the form on the application.\nIsormorphic-Fetch - Isomorphic-fetch is implementation of fetch for both Node.js and browser, this was used to communicate with the backend (server) and used to fetch data stored on the server database and pulled to the frontend.\nThe rest of the libraries/frameworks can be found in the package.json file on the root directory of the project. Any developer that will be doing further work on the project can find the documentation on the README.MD file on the GitHub page useful and straightforward.\n\nLIBRARIES &amp; FRAMEWORKS ON THE BACK END\nNode JS â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side.\nExpress JS â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side.\nMongoose â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code \nJson2cvs â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side.\n\n\n \n",

This new offering will be called Zone.Health. The ask is to build a website that acts as the hub of information in order to get patients to join their program. The various sections of the site will consist of: \n\nâ€¢\tâ—  What is Zone.health? \nâ€¢\tâ—  The program \nâ€¢\tâ—  Why it works? \nâ€¢\tâ—  Join now \nâ€¢\tâ—  Pricing \nâ€¢\tâ—  FAQs \n\nWe envisage the website to have an onboarding portal which will consist of three parts, an API, a CMS and a Frontend system.\n\n1.\tThis will allow for future integration into other customer touch points should the need arise. The onboarding journey will consist of: \n\n1) BMI calculator\n\nIf less 27, show a message to say that they donâ€™t qualify. If greater 27, take the user through the registration flow. \n\n2) Registration (numerous inputs)\n\nOnce the patient has provided the above, they will be visible within the custom built CMS. The practitioner will have a login to the CMS whereby they will be able to view the information captured by the patient. They would be able to add specific notes after the consultation and select the medication and the required gear (glucose monitor, wearable and scale) to send to the patient. The idea is that the cost of these items will be built into the system, so that the practitioner can simply select the products, which then creates the payment link. This will be centrally managed in its totality in the CMS. \nOnce the payment has been made, the kit will be delivered to the patient and the engagement with Zone.Health will be through the app. However, each month, the practitioner will log into the CMS and create a payment link based on the progress the patient is making. \n\nAll invoices and orders will be available to the patient when logging into the site. It is important to note that the onboarding portal and the mobile app (this has been developed separately and not in the scope of this project) should use the same authentication system in order to prevent the patient having to create two seperate accounts. \nDetails will be provided once engagement starts, but we expect the website to consist of:\n\no\tâ—  Project set up \no\tâ—  Information website build \no\tâ—  BMI \no\tâ—  Registration \no\tâ—  Further screening questions \no\tâ—  Laboratory Test Uploads \no\tâ—  Schedule a visit \no\tâ—  Confirmation \no\tâ—  Payment Process \no\tâ—  Account Settings \no\tâ—  CMS - View users \no\tâ—  CMS - Create payments \no\tâ—  CMS - Shipment of your ZoneHealth kit notification \no\tâ—  Email Templates Creation \no\tâ—  Email Provider Integration \no\tâ—  CRM Integration \no\tâ—  Scheduling System Integration \no\tâ—  Payment Provider Integration \nVideo Conferencing Integration \n\nThere are similar businesses in the US and we like this the most: https://joinfound.com\n\n",

        "description": "I have a 3D modding application for Final Fantasy VII, and itâ€™s missing critical animation tools. The main things I think it's missing are a Gizmo to move and rotate joints in 3D space, animation splines to make adjustments to direction and speed, and a real animation bar at the bottom displaying your key frames and etc. It's also lacking automatic interpolation between the keys so you can play test the animation without manually adding additional frames, this makes it much harder if you need an animation\nto stay within a certain number of frames. The app has an animation retargeting feature, but it could probably be rounded out a bit more to work more like Maya or Unreal. If possible, it would be helpful to make the app platform agnostic so it can work on both Windows and Mac. If thatâ€™s too much reworking, then maybe just a Mac version as well. This isnâ€™t an absolute necessity, I currently use the app with Wine, but an app that can work natively would be much better. \n\nI didnâ€™t set a budget because Iâ€™m not sure what something like this would cost, and I didnâ€™t want to discourage anyone from applying. If youâ€™re interested let me know what you think, and how much you think you could complete this for. \n\nThe source code and application is here: \n\nhttps://github.com/LaZar00/KimeraCS\n",

        "description": "I have a 3D modding application for Final Fantasy VII, and itâ€™s missing critical animation tools. The main things I think it's missing are a Gizmo to move and rotate joints in 3D space, animation splines to make adjustments to direction and speed, and a real animation bar at the bottom displaying your key frames and etc. It's also lacking automatic interpolation between the keys so you can play test the animation without manually adding additional frames, this makes it much harder if you need an animation\nto stay within a certain number of frames. The app has an animation retargeting feature, but it could probably be rounded out a bit more to work more like Maya or Unreal. If possible, it would be helpful to make the app platform agnostic so it can work on both Windows and Mac. If thatâ€™s too much reworking, then maybe just a Mac version as well. This isnâ€™t an absolute necessity, I currently use the app with Wine, but an app that can work natively would be much better. \n\nI didnâ€™t set a budget because Iâ€™m not sure what something like this would cost, and I didnâ€™t want to discourage anyone from applying. If youâ€™re interested let me know what you think, and how much you think you could complete this for. \n\nThe source code and application is here: \n\nhttps://github.com/LaZar00/KimeraCS\n",

        "description": "I have a 3D modding application for Final Fantasy VII, and itâ€™s missing critical animation tools. The main things I think it's missing are a Gizmo to move and rotate joints in 3D space, animation splines to make adjustments to direction and speed, and a real animation bar at the bottom displaying your key frames and etc. It's also lacking automatic interpolation between the keys so you can play test the animation without manually adding additional frames, this makes it much harder if you need an animation\nto stay within a certain number of frames. The app has an animation retargeting feature, but it could probably be rounded out a bit more to work more like Maya or Unreal. If possible, it would be helpful to make the app platform agnostic so it can work on both Windows and Mac. If thatâ€™s too much reworking, then maybe just a Mac version as well. This isnâ€™t an absolute necessity, I currently use the app with Wine, but an app that can work natively would be much better. \n\nI didnâ€™t set a budget because Iâ€™m not sure what something like this would cost, and I didnâ€™t want to discourage anyone from applying. If youâ€™re interested let me know what you think, and how much you think you could complete this for. \n\nThe source code and application is here: \n\nhttps://github.com/LaZar00/KimeraCS\n",

        "description": "I have an interactive website that needs to be updated. The purpose of the site is to collect comments from users who are directed to the site. I would like a freelancer to propose a price for this work.  \n\nAt the site users log in with a username and password that I provide. The project to which they are assigned opens and user then adds one or more comments. There are multiple projects and multiple users so that login credentials ensures that the user accesses the correct project. I have admin rights on the site to set up projects, set up users, assign users to projects and download data collected. I need to make clear that I am not a website administrator, nor do I have deep skills in the technology. While I am tech savvy in a number of areas, and I have managed many tech development projects through Upwork and the predecessor companies. The freelancer will need to communicate with me at my level of understanding. \n\nThe site has not been used much recently and the code is now out of date. Most parts of the site seem to work ok except when a user logs in, their project does not open. I need a freelancer to review the code and update the site (patches, fixes, etc.). I do not need a redesign or new functionality; I only need the code updated. I do have more detailed documentation that I can share with freelancers that are shortlisted. The freelancer who created the site did great work but they are not available at this time so I need a new freelancer who can do this work. \n\nI have accounts on Heroku and Vercel to support this site and the below is a brief summary of the documentation from the freelancer that created the project.\nLIBRARIES &amp; FRAMEWORKS ON THE FRONT END\nReact JS - React is an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components.\nNext JS â€“ Was used to build server-side rendering and static web applications using React.\nStyled-Components â€“ This utilizes tagged template literals to style the components.\nMaterial-UI - React components for faster and easier web development.\nJs-Cookie â€“ Is a simple, lightweight JavaScript API for handling browser cookies, this was used to read the cookie token stored in the browser and was used for authenticating users as soon as they are signed in using the form on the application.\nIsormorphic-Fetch - Isomorphic-fetch is implementation of fetch for both Node.js and browser, this was used to communicate with the backend (server) and used to fetch data stored on the server database and pulled to the frontend.\nThe rest of the libraries/frameworks can be found in the package.json file on the root directory of the project. Any developer that will be doing further work on the project can find the documentation on the README.MD file on the GitHub page useful and straightforward.\n\nLIBRARIES &amp; FRAMEWORKS ON THE BACK END\nNode JS â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side.\nExpress JS â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side.\nMongoose â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code \nJson2cvs â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side.\n\n\n \n",

        "description": "GluCare was born out of the idea that a combination of a human-centric patient approach and a technology working together will lead to a better and more efficient management of diabetes and metabolic syndrome. \n\nThe GluCare team is looking to expand their successful business model from physical interaction to service in the cloud. This new offering will be called Zone.Health. The ask is to build a website that acts as the hub of information in order to get patients to join their program. The various sections of the site will consist of: \n\nâ€¢\tâ—  What is Zone.health? \nâ€¢\tâ—  The program \nâ€¢\tâ—  Why it works? \nâ€¢\tâ—  Join now \nâ€¢\tâ—  Pricing \nâ€¢\tâ—  FAQs \n\nWe envisage the website to have an onboarding portal which will consist of three parts, an API, a CMS and a Frontend system.\n\n1.\tThis will allow for future integration into other customer touch points should the need arise. The onboarding journey will consist of: \n\n1) BMI calculator\n\nIf less 27, show a message to say that they donâ€™t qualify. If greater 27, take the user through the registration flow. \n\n2) Registration (numerous inputs)\n\nOnce the patient has provided the above, they will be visible within the custom built CMS. The practitioner will have a login to the CMS whereby they will be able to view the information captured by the patient. They would be able to add specific notes after the consultation and select the medication and the required gear (glucose monitor, wearable and scale) to send to the patient. The idea is that the cost of these items will be built into the system, so that the practitioner can simply select the products, which then creates the payment link. This will be centrally managed in its totality in the CMS. \nOnce the payment has been made, the kit will be delivered to the patient and the engagement with Zone.Health will be through the app. However, each month, the practitioner will log into the CMS and create a payment link based on the progress the patient is making. \n\nAll invoices and orders will be available to the patient when logging into the site. It is important to note that the onboarding portal and the mobile app (this has been developed separately and not in the scope of this project) should use the same authentication system in order to prevent the patient having to create two seperate accounts. \nDetails will be provided once engagement starts, but we expect the website to consist of:\n\no\tâ—  Project set up \no\tâ—  Information website build \no\tâ—  BMI \no\tâ—  Registration \no\tâ—  Further screening questions \no\tâ—  Laboratory Test Uploads \no\tâ—  Schedule a visit \no\tâ—  Confirmation \no\tâ—  Payment Process \no\tâ—  Account Settings \no\tâ—  CMS - View users \no\tâ—  CMS - Create payments \no\tâ—  CMS - Shipment of your ZoneHealth kit notification \no\tâ—  Email Templates Creation \no\tâ—  Email Provider Integration \no\tâ—  CRM Integration \no\tâ—  Scheduling System Integration \no\tâ—  Payment Provider Integration \nVideo Conferencing Integration \n\nThere are similar businesses in the US and we like this the most: https://joinfound.com\n\n",

        "description": "I have a 3D modding application for Final Fantasy VII, and itâ€™s missing critical animation tools. The main things I think it's missing are a Gizmo to move and rotate joints in 3D space, animation splines to make adjustments to direction and speed, and a real animation bar at the bottom displaying your key frames and etc. It's also lacking automatic interpolation between the keys so you can play test the animation without manually adding additional frames, this makes it much harder if you need an animation\nto stay within a certain number of frames. The app has an animation retargeting feature, but it could probably be rounded out a bit more to work more like Maya or Unreal. If possible, it would be helpful to make the app platform agnostic so it can work on both Windows and Mac. If thatâ€™s too much reworking, then maybe just a Mac version as well. This isnâ€™t an absolute necessity, I currently use the app with Wine, but an app that can work natively would be much better. \n\nI didnâ€™t set a budget because Iâ€™m not sure what something like this would cost, and I didnâ€™t want to discourage anyone from applying. If youâ€™re interested let me know what you think, and how much you think you could complete this for. \n\nThe source code and application is here: \n\nhttps://github.com/LaZar00/KimeraCS\n",

Our current website is ugly and not worth the paid advertisement. \n\nWe are looking for customization. We do not expect you to create art from scratch, but we definitely need a website that looks like our own. You will need moderate graphic design skills.\n\nWe will have a screen where we showcase the app features and another screen where we'll add informative blogs. That is all, it's not a big project.\n\nSEO knowledge is important, not because we'll try to push high on organic ranking but at least because we want to do something that does not go against the ranking algorithm.\n\nIf you have made any projects for mobile application landing pages, please do share. We'll look at each of them and it will have a big impact on our decision.\n\nThat's pretty much it, if I'm missing anything please ask. I'll respond as fast as I can.",

        "description": "GluCare was born out of the idea that a combination of a human-centric patient approach and a technology working together will lead to a better and more efficient management of diabetes and metabolic syndrome. \n\nThe GluCare team is looking to expand their successful business model from physical interaction to service in the cloud. This new offering will be called Zone.Health. The ask is to build a website that acts as the hub of information in order to get patients to join their program. The various sections of the site will consist of: \n\nâ€¢\tâ—  What is Zone.health? \nâ€¢\tâ—  The program \nâ€¢\tâ—  Why it works? \nâ€¢\tâ—  Join now \nâ€¢\tâ—  Pricing \nâ€¢\tâ—  FAQs \n\nWe envisage the website to have an onboarding portal which will consist of three parts, an API, a CMS and a Frontend system.\n\n1.\tThis will allow for future integration into other customer touch points should the need arise. The onboarding journey will consist of: \n\n1) BMI calculator\n\nIf less 27, show a message to say that they donâ€™t qualify. If greater 27, take the user through the registration flow. \n\n2) Registration (numerous inputs)\n\nOnce the patient has provided the above, they will be visible within the custom built CMS. The practitioner will have a login to the CMS whereby they will be able to view the information captured by the patient. They would be able to add specific notes after the consultation and select the medication and the required gear (glucose monitor, wearable and scale) to send to the patient. The idea is that the cost of these items will be built into the system, so that the practitioner can simply select the products, which then creates the payment link. This will be centrally managed in its totality in the CMS. \nOnce the payment has been made, the kit will be delivered to the patient and the engagement with Zone.Health will be through the app. However, each month, the practitioner will log into the CMS and create a payment link based on the progress the patient is making. \n\nAll invoices and orders will be available to the patient when logging into the site. It is important to note that the onboarding portal and the mobile app (this has been developed separately and not in the scope of this project) should use the same authentication system in order to prevent the patient having to create two seperate accounts. \nDetails will be provided once engagement starts, but we expect the website to consist of:\n\no\tâ—  Project set up \no\tâ—  Information website build \no\tâ—  BMI \no\tâ—  Registration \no\tâ—  Further screening questions \no\tâ—  Laboratory Test Uploads \no\tâ—  Schedule a visit \no\tâ—  Confirmation \no\tâ—  Payment Process \no\tâ—  Account Settings \no\tâ—  CMS - View users \no\tâ—  CMS - Create payments \no\tâ—  CMS - Shipment of your ZoneHealth kit notification \no\tâ—  Email Templates Creation \no\tâ—  Email Provider Integration \no\tâ—  CRM Integration \no\tâ—  Scheduling System Integration \no\tâ—  Payment Provider Integration \nVideo Conferencing Integration \n\nThere are similar businesses in the US and we like this the most: https://joinfound.com\n\n",

I would like a freelancer to propose a price for this work.  \n\nAt the site users log in with a username and password that I provide. The project to which they are assigned opens and user then adds one or more comments. There are multiple projects and multiple users so that login credentials ensures that the user accesses the correct project. I have admin rights on the site to set up projects, set up users, assign users to projects and download data collected. I need to make clear that I am not a website administrator, nor do I have deep skills in the technology. While I am tech savvy in a number of areas, and I have managed many tech development projects through Upwork and the predecessor companies. The freelancer will need to communicate with me at my level of understanding. \n\nThe site has not been used much recently and the code is now out of date. Most parts of the site seem to work ok except when a user logs in, their project does not open. I need a freelancer to review the code and update the site (patches, fixes, etc.). I do not need a redesign or new functionality; I only need the code updated. I do have more detailed documentation that I can share with freelancers that are shortlisted. The freelancer who created the site did great work but they are not available at this time so I need a new freelancer who can do this work. \n\nI have accounts on Heroku and Vercel to support this site and the below is a brief summary of the documentation from the freelancer that created the project.\nLIBRARIES &amp; FRAMEWORKS ON THE FRONT END\nReact JS - React is an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components.\nNext JS â€“ Was used to build server-side rendering and static web applications using React.\nStyled-Components â€“ This utilizes tagged template literals to style the components.\nMaterial-UI - React components for faster and easier web development.\nJs-Cookie â€“ Is a simple, lightweight JavaScript API for handling browser cookies, this was used to read the cookie token stored in the browser and was used for authenticating users as soon as they are signed in using the form on the application.\nIsormorphic-Fetch - Isomorphic-fetch is implementation of fetch for both Node.js and browser, this was used to communicate with the backend (server) and used to fetch data stored on the server database and pulled to the frontend.\nThe rest of the libraries/frameworks can be found in the package.json file on the root directory of the project. Any developer that will be doing further work on the project can find the documentation on the README.MD file on the GitHub page useful and straightforward.\n\nLIBRARIES &amp; FRAMEWORKS ON THE BACK END\nNode JS â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side.\nExpress JS â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side.\nMongoose â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code \nJson2cvs â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side.\n\n\n \n",

        "description": "GluCare was born out of the idea that a combination of a human-centric patient approach and a technology working together will lead to a better and more efficient management of diabetes and metabolic syndrome. \n\nThe GluCare team is looking to expand their successful business model from physical interaction to service in the cloud. This new offering will be called Zone.Health. The ask is to build a website that acts as the hub of information in order to get patients to join their program. The various sections of the site will consist of: \n\nâ€¢\tâ—  What is Zone.health? \nâ€¢\tâ—  The program \nâ€¢\tâ—  Why it works? \nâ€¢\tâ—  Join now \nâ€¢\tâ—  Pricing \nâ€¢\tâ—  FAQs \n\nWe envisage the website to have an onboarding portal which will consist of three parts, an API, a CMS and a Frontend system.\n\n1.\tThis will allow for future integration into other customer touch points should the need arise. The onboarding journey will consist of: \n\n1) BMI calculator\n\nIf less 27, show a message to say that they donâ€™t qualify. If greater 27, take the user through the registration flow. \n\n2) Registration (numerous inputs)\n\nOnce the patient has provided the above, they will be visible within the custom built CMS. The practitioner will have a login to the CMS whereby they will be able to view the information captured by the patient. They would be able to add specific notes after the consultation and select the medication and the required gear (glucose monitor, wearable and scale) to send to the patient. The idea is that the cost of these items will be built into the system, so that the practitioner can simply select the products, which then creates the payment link. This will be centrally managed in its totality in the CMS. \nOnce the payment has been made, the kit will be delivered to the patient and the engagement with Zone.Health will be through the app. However, each month, the practitioner will log into the CMS and create a payment link based on the progress the patient is making. \n\nAll invoices and orders will be available to the patient when logging into the site. It is important to note that the onboarding portal and the mobile app (this has been developed separately and not in the scope of this project) should use the same authentication system in order to prevent the patient having to create two seperate accounts. \nDetails will be provided once engagement starts, but we expect the website to consist of:\n\no\tâ—  Project set up \no\tâ—  Information website build \no\tâ—  BMI \no\tâ—  Registration \no\tâ—  Further screening questions \no\tâ—  Laboratory Test Uploads \no\tâ—  Schedule a visit \no\tâ—  Confirmation \no\tâ—  Payment Process \no\tâ—  Account Settings \no\tâ—  CMS - View users \no\tâ—  CMS - Create payments \no\tâ—  CMS - Shipment of your ZoneHealth kit notification \no\tâ—  Email Templates Creation \no\tâ—  Email Provider Integration \no\tâ—  CRM Integration \no\tâ—  Scheduling System Integration \no\tâ—  Payment Provider Integration \nVideo Conferencing Integration \n\nThere are similar businesses in the US and we like this the most: https://joinfound.com\n\n",

Most parts of the site seem to work ok except when a user logs in, their project does not open. I need a freelancer to review the code and update the site (patches, fixes, etc.). I do not need a redesign or new functionality; I only need the code updated. I do have more detailed documentation that I can share with freelancers that are shortlisted. The freelancer who created the site did great work but they are not available at this time so I need a new freelancer who can do this work. \n\nI have accounts on Heroku and Vercel to support this site and the below is a brief summary of the documentation from the freelancer that created the project.\nLIBRARIES &amp; FRAMEWORKS ON THE FRONT END\nReact JS - React is an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components.\nNext JS â€“ Was used to build server-side rendering and static web applications using React.\nStyled-Components â€“ This utilizes tagged template literals to style the components.\nMaterial-UI - React components for faster and easier web development.\nJs-Cookie â€“ Is a simple, lightweight JavaScript API for handling browser cookies, this was used to read the cookie token stored in the browser and was used for authenticating users as soon as they are signed in using the form on the application.\nIsormorphic-Fetch - Isomorphic-fetch is implementation of fetch for both Node.js and browser, this was used to communicate with the backend (server) and used to fetch data stored on the server database and pulled to the frontend.\nThe rest of the libraries/frameworks can be found in the package.json file on the root directory of the project. Any developer that will be doing further work on the project can find the documentation on the README.MD file on the GitHub page useful and straightforward.\n\nLIBRARIES &amp; FRAMEWORKS ON THE BACK END\nNode JS â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side.\nExpress JS â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side.\nMongoose â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code \nJson2cvs â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side.\n\n\n \n",

        "description": "GluCare was born out of the idea that a combination of a human-centric patient approach and a technology working together will lead to a better and more efficient management of diabetes and metabolic syndrome. \n\nThe GluCare team is looking to expand their successful business model from physical interaction to service in the cloud. This new offering will be called Zone.Health. The ask is to build a website that acts as the hub of information in order to get patients to join their program. The various sections of the site will consist of: \n\nâ€¢\tâ—  What is Zone.health? \nâ€¢\tâ—  The program \nâ€¢\tâ—  Why it works? \nâ€¢\tâ—  Join now \nâ€¢\tâ—  Pricing \nâ€¢\tâ—  FAQs \n\nWe envisage the website to have an onboarding portal which will consist of three parts, an API, a CMS and a Frontend system.\n\n1.\tThis will allow for future integration into other customer touch points should the need arise. The onboarding journey will consist of: \n\n1) BMI calculator\n\nIf less 27, show a message to say that they donâ€™t qualify. If greater 27, take the user through the registration flow. \n\n2) Registration (numerous inputs)\n\nOnce the patient has provided the above, they will be visible within the custom built CMS. The practitioner will have a login to the CMS whereby they will be able to view the information captured by the patient. They would be able to add specific notes after the consultation and select the medication and the required gear (glucose monitor, wearable and scale) to send to the patient. The idea is that the cost of these items will be built into the system, so that the practitioner can simply select the products, which then creates the payment link. This will be centrally managed in its totality in the CMS. \nOnce the payment has been made, the kit will be delivered to the patient and the engagement with Zone.Health will be through the app. However, each month, the practitioner will log into the CMS and create a payment link based on the progress the patient is making. \n\nAll invoices and orders will be available to the patient when logging into the site. It is important to note that the onboarding portal and the mobile app (this has been developed separately and not in the scope of this project) should use the same authentication system in order to prevent the patient having to create two seperate accounts. \nDetails will be provided once engagement starts, but we expect the website to consist of:\n\no\tâ—  Project set up \no\tâ—  Information website build \no\tâ—  BMI \no\tâ—  Registration \no\tâ—  Further screening questions \no\tâ—  Laboratory Test Uploads \no\tâ—  Schedule a visit \no\tâ—  Confirmation \no\tâ—  Payment Process \no\tâ—  Account Settings \no\tâ—  CMS - View users \no\tâ—  CMS - Create payments \no\tâ—  CMS - Shipment of your ZoneHealth kit notification \no\tâ—  Email Templates Creation \no\tâ—  Email Provider Integration \no\tâ—  CRM Integration \no\tâ—  Scheduling System Integration \no\tâ—  Payment Provider Integration \nVideo Conferencing Integration \n\nThere are similar businesses in the US and we like this the most: https://joinfound.com\n\n",

I would like a freelancer to propose a price for this work.  \n\nAt the site users log in with a username and password that I provide. The project to which they are assigned opens and user then adds one or more comments. There are multiple projects and multiple users so that login credentials ensures that the user accesses the correct project. I have admin rights on the site to set up projects, set up users, assign users to projects and download data collected. I need to make clear that I am not a website administrator, nor do I have deep skills in the technology. While I am tech savvy in a number of areas, and I have managed many tech development projects through Upwork and the predecessor companies. The freelancer will need to communicate with me at my level of understanding. \n\nThe site has not been used much recently and the code is now out of date. Most parts of the site seem to work ok except when a user logs in, their project does not open. I need a freelancer to review the code and update the site (patches, fixes, etc.). I do not need a redesign or new functionality; I only need the code updated. I do have more detailed documentation that I can share with freelancers that are shortlisted. The freelancer who created the site did great work but they are not available at this time so I need a new freelancer who can do this work. \n\nI have accounts on Heroku and Vercel to support this site and the below is a brief summary of the documentation from the freelancer that created the project.\nLIBRARIES &amp; FRAMEWORKS ON THE FRONT END\nReact JS - React is an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components.\nNext JS â€“ Was used to build server-side rendering and static web applications using React.\nStyled-Components â€“ This utilizes tagged template literals to style the components.\nMaterial-UI - React components for faster and easier web development.\nJs-Cookie â€“ Is a simple, lightweight JavaScript API for handling browser cookies, this was used to read the cookie token stored in the browser and was used for authenticating users as soon as they are signed in using the form on the application.\nIsormorphic-Fetch - Isomorphic-fetch is implementation of fetch for both Node.js and browser, this was used to communicate with the backend (server) and used to fetch data stored on the server database and pulled to the frontend.\nThe rest of the libraries/frameworks can be found in the package.json file on the root directory of the project. Any developer that will be doing further work on the project can find the documentation on the README.MD file on the GitHub page useful and straightforward.\n\nLIBRARIES &amp; FRAMEWORKS ON THE BACK END\nNode JS â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side.\nExpress JS â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side.\nMongoose â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code \nJson2cvs â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side.\n\n\n \n",

        "description": "I would like someone to pull all the publicly available Uber data of the city of Miami from https://movement.uber.com/explore/miami/travel-times\n\nWith the data provided, is it possible (with this data) to figure out how many rides come from each zone/neighborhood of Miami? I think we need to extrapolate that based on the number of rows but I'm not sure, so I need your help to figure this out. I was having trouble because the dataset is too large to open it all at once in Excel.\n\nOnce you know the number rides coming *out* of each zone/neighborhood:\n\n1. Break the data down and put it into excel based on all the categories that they have already tagged the data with but do it by zone/neighborhood: \n\nRides by Hour of Day (All Days)\t\nRides  by Hour of Day (Weekdays Only)\t\nRides  by Hour of Day (Weekends Only)\t\nRides  by Day of Week\t\nRides  by Month (All Days)\t\nRides  by Month (Weekdays Only)\t\nRides  by Month (Weekends Only)\t\nRides  By Date By Hour Buckets (All Days)\n\n2. Create visuals for each each zone in a manner that you feel is the ideal way to present it. Open to suggestions here.\n\nThank you.",

        "description": "GluCare was born out of the idea that a combination of a human-centric patient approach and a technology working together will lead to a better and more efficient management of diabetes and metabolic syndrome. \n\nThe GluCare team is looking to expand their successful business model from physical interaction to service in the cloud. This new offering will be called Zone.Health. The ask is to build a website that acts as the hub of information in order to get patients to join their program. The various sections of the site will consist of: \n\nâ€¢\tâ—  What is Zone.health? \nâ€¢\tâ—  The program \nâ€¢\tâ—  Why it works? \nâ€¢\tâ—  Join now \nâ€¢\tâ—  Pricing \nâ€¢\tâ—  FAQs \n\nWe envisage the website to have an onboarding portal which will consist of three parts, an API, a CMS and a Frontend system.\n\n1.\tThis will allow for future integration into other customer touch points should the need arise. The onboarding journey will consist of: \n\n1) BMI calculator\n\nIf less 27, show a message to say that they donâ€™t qualify. If greater 27, take the user through the registration flow. \n\n2) Registration (numerous inputs)\n\nOnce the patient has provided the above, they will be visible within the custom built CMS. The practitioner will have a login to the CMS whereby they will be able to view the information captured by the patient. They would be able to add specific notes after the consultation and select the medication and the required gear (glucose monitor, wearable and scale) to send to the patient. The idea is that the cost of these items will be built into the system, so that the practitioner can simply select the products, which then creates the payment link. This will be centrally managed in its totality in the CMS. \nOnce the payment has been made, the kit will be delivered to the patient and the engagement with Zone.Health will be through the app. However, each month, the practitioner will log into the CMS and create a payment link based on the progress the patient is making. \n\nAll invoices and orders will be available to the patient when logging into the site. It is important to note that the onboarding portal and the mobile app (this has been developed separately and not in the scope of this project) should use the same authentication system in order to prevent the patient having to create two seperate accounts. \nDetails will be provided once engagement starts, but we expect the website to consist of:\n\no\tâ—  Project set up \no\tâ—  Information website build \no\tâ—  BMI \no\tâ—  Registration \no\tâ—  Further screening questions \no\tâ—  Laboratory Test Uploads \no\tâ—  Schedule a visit \no\tâ—  Confirmation \no\tâ—  Payment Process \no\tâ—  Account Settings \no\tâ—  CMS - View users \no\tâ—  CMS - Create payments \no\tâ—  CMS - Shipment of your ZoneHealth kit notification \no\tâ—  Email Templates Creation \no\tâ—  Email Provider Integration \no\tâ—  CRM Integration \no\tâ—  Scheduling System Integration \no\tâ—  Payment Provider Integration \nVideo Conferencing Integration \n\nThere are similar businesses in the US and we like this the most: https://joinfound.com\n\n",

        "description": "I have a 3D modding application for Final Fantasy VII, and itâ€™s missing critical animation tools. The main things I think it's missing are a Gizmo to move and rotate joints in 3D space, animation splines to make adjustments to direction and speed, and a real animation bar at the bottom displaying your key frames and etc. It's also lacking automatic interpolation between the keys so you can play test the animation without manually adding additional frames, this makes it much harder if you need an animation\nto stay within a certain number of frames. The app has an animation retargeting feature, but it could probably be rounded out a bit more to work more like Maya or Unreal. If possible, it would be helpful to make the app platform agnostic so it can work on both Windows and Mac. If thatâ€™s too much reworking, then maybe just a Mac version as well. This isnâ€™t an absolute necessity, I currently use the app with Wine, but an app that can work natively would be much better. \n\nI didnâ€™t set a budget because Iâ€™m not sure what something like this would cost, and I didnâ€™t want to discourage anyone from applying. If youâ€™re interested let me know what you think, and how much you think you could complete this for. \n\nThe source code and application is here: \n\nhttps://github.com/LaZar00/KimeraCS\n",

        "description": "GluCare was born out of the idea that a combination of a human-centric patient approach and a technology working together will lead to a better and more efficient management of diabetes and metabolic syndrome. \n\nThe GluCare team is looking to expand their successful business model from physical interaction to service in the cloud. This new offering will be called Zone.Health. The ask is to build a website that acts as the hub of information in order to get patients to join their program. The various sections of the site will consist of: \n\nâ€¢\tâ—  What is Zone.health? \nâ€¢\tâ—  The program \nâ€¢\tâ—  Why it works? \nâ€¢\tâ—  Join now \nâ€¢\tâ—  Pricing \nâ€¢\tâ—  FAQs \n\nWe envisage the website to have an onboarding portal which will consist of three parts, an API, a CMS and a Frontend system.\n\n1.\tThis will allow for future integration into other customer touch points should the need arise. The onboarding journey will consist of: \n\n1) BMI calculator\n\nIf less 27, show a message to say that they donâ€™t qualify. If greater 27, take the user through the registration flow. \n\n2) Registration (numerous inputs)\n\nOnce the patient has provided the above, they will be visible within the custom built CMS. The practitioner will have a login to the CMS whereby they will be able to view the information captured by the patient. They would be able to add specific notes after the consultation and select the medication and the required gear (glucose monitor, wearable and scale) to send to the patient. The idea is that the cost of these items will be built into the system, so that the practitioner can simply select the products, which then creates the payment link. This will be centrally managed in its totality in the CMS. \nOnce the payment has been made, the kit will be delivered to the patient and the engagement with Zone.Health will be through the app. However, each month, the practitioner will log into the CMS and create a payment link based on the progress the patient is making. \n\nAll invoices and orders will be available to the patient when logging into the site. It is important to note that the onboarding portal and the mobile app (this has been developed separately and not in the scope of this project) should use the same authentication system in order to prevent the patient having to create two seperate accounts. \nDetails will be provided once engagement starts, but we expect the website to consist of:\n\no\tâ—  Project set up \no\tâ—  Information website build \no\tâ—  BMI \no\tâ—  Registration \no\tâ—  Further screening questions \no\tâ—  Laboratory Test Uploads \no\tâ—  Schedule a visit \no\tâ—  Confirmation \no\tâ—  Payment Process \no\tâ—  Account Settings \no\tâ—  CMS - View users \no\tâ—  CMS - Create payments \no\tâ—  CMS - Shipment of your ZoneHealth kit notification \no\tâ—  Email Templates Creation \no\tâ—  Email Provider Integration \no\tâ—  CRM Integration \no\tâ—  Scheduling System Integration \no\tâ—  Payment Provider Integration \nVideo Conferencing Integration \n\nThere are similar businesses in the US and we like this the most: https://joinfound.com\n\n",

I would like a freelancer to propose a price for this work.  \n\nAt the site users log in with a username and password that I provide. The project to which they are assigned opens and user then adds one or more comments. There are multiple projects and multiple users so that login credentials ensures that the user accesses the correct project. I have admin rights on the site to set up projects, set up users, assign users to projects and download data collected. I need to make clear that I am not a website administrator, nor do I have deep skills in the technology. While I am tech savvy in a number of areas, and I have managed many tech development projects through Upwork and the predecessor companies. The freelancer will need to communicate with me at my level of understanding. \n\nThe site has not been used much recently and the code is now out of date. Most parts of the site seem to work ok except when a user logs in, their project does not open. I need a freelancer to review the code and update the site (patches, fixes, etc.).

The freelancer who created the site did great work but they are not available at this time so I need a new freelancer who can do this work. \n\nI have accounts on Heroku and Vercel to support this site and the below is a brief summary of the documentation from the freelancer that created the project.\nLIBRARIES &amp; FRAMEWORKS ON THE FRONT END\nReact JS - React is an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components.\nNext JS â€“ Was used to build server-side rendering and static web applications using React.\nStyled-Components â€“ This utilizes tagged template literals to style the components.\nMaterial-UI - React components for faster and easier web development.\nJs-Cookie â€“ Is a simple, lightweight JavaScript API for handling browser cookies, this was used to read the cookie token stored in the browser and was used for authenticating users as soon as they are signed in using the form on the application.\nIsormorphic-Fetch - Isomorphic-fetch is implementation of fetch for both Node.js and browser, this was used to communicate with the backend (server) and used to fetch data stored on the server database and pulled to the frontend.\nThe rest of the libraries/frameworks can be found in the package.json file on the root directory of the project.

But the underlying focus is always that the Client is satisfied. \nWhen there are questions I can support and help with implementation questions or design.\n\nYou should also know how update sets work.\n\nThe Project takes about 40h And will end at mid September the latest.\n\nFeel free to apply,\nMax\n\n\n",

        "description": "GluCare was born out of the idea that a combination of a human-centric patient approach and a technology working together will lead to a better and more efficient management of diabetes and metabolic syndrome. \n\nThe GluCare team is looking to expand their successful business model from physical interaction to service in the cloud. This new offering will be called Zone.Health. The ask is to build a website that acts as the hub of information in order to get patients to join their program. The various sections of the site will consist of: \n\nâ€¢\tâ—  What is Zone.health? \nâ€¢\tâ—  The program \nâ€¢\tâ—  Why it works? \nâ€¢\tâ—  Join now \nâ€¢\tâ—  Pricing \nâ€¢\tâ—  FAQs \n\nWe envisage the website to have an onboarding portal which will consist of three parts, an API, a CMS and a Frontend system.\n\n1.\tThis will allow for future integration into other customer touch points should the need arise. The onboarding journey will consist of: \n\n1) BMI calculator\n\nIf less 27, show a message to say that they donâ€™t qualify. If greater 27, take the user through the registration flow. \n\n2) Registration (numerous inputs)\n\nOnce the patient has provided the above, they will be visible within the custom built CMS. The practitioner will have a login to the CMS whereby they will be able to view the information captured by the patient. They would be able to add specific notes after the consultation and select the medication and the required gear (glucose monitor, wearable and scale) to send to the patient. The idea is that the cost of these items will be built into the system, so that the practitioner can simply select the products, which then creates the payment link. This will be centrally managed in its totality in the CMS. \nOnce the payment has been made, the kit will be delivered to the patient and the engagement with Zone.Health will be through the app. However, each month, the practitioner will log into the CMS and create a payment link based on the progress the patient is making. \n\nAll invoices and orders will be available to the patient when logging into the site. It is important to note that the onboarding portal and the mobile app (this has been developed separately and not in the scope of this project) should use the same authentication system in order to prevent the patient having to create two seperate accounts. \nDetails will be provided once engagement starts, but we expect the website to consist of:\n\no\tâ—  Project set up \no\tâ—  Information website build \no\tâ—  BMI \no\tâ—  Registration \no\tâ—  Further screening questions \no\tâ—  Laboratory Test Uploads \no\tâ—  Schedule a visit \no\tâ—  Confirmation \no\tâ—  Payment Process \no\tâ—  Account Settings \no\tâ—  CMS - View users \no\tâ—  CMS - Create payments \no\tâ—  CMS - Shipment of your ZoneHealth kit notification \no\tâ—  Email Templates Creation \no\tâ—  Email Provider Integration \no\tâ—  CRM Integration \no\tâ—  Scheduling System Integration \no\tâ—  Payment Provider Integration \nVideo Conferencing Integration \n\nThere are similar businesses in the US and we like this the most: https://joinfound.com\n\n",

        "description": "I have a 3D modding application for Final Fantasy VII, and itâ€™s missing critical animation tools. The main things I think it's missing are a Gizmo to move and rotate joints in 3D space, animation splines to make adjustments to direction and speed, and a real animation bar at the bottom displaying your key frames and etc. It's also lacking automatic interpolation between the keys so you can play test the animation without manually adding additional frames, this makes it much harder if you need an animation\nto stay within a certain number of frames. The app has an animation retargeting feature, but it could probably be rounded out a bit more to work more like Maya or Unreal. If possible, it would be helpful to make the app platform agnostic so it can work on both Windows and Mac. If thatâ€™s too much reworking, then maybe just a Mac version as well. This isnâ€™t an absolute necessity, I currently use the app with Wine, but an app that can work natively would be much better. \n\nI didnâ€™t set a budget because Iâ€™m not sure what something like this would cost, and I didnâ€™t want to discourage anyone from applying. If youâ€™re interested let me know what you think, and how much you think you could complete this for. \n\nThe source code and application is here: \n\nhttps://github.com/LaZar00/KimeraCS\n",

        "description": "GluCare was born out of the idea that a combination of a human-centric patient approach and a technology working together will lead to a better and more efficient management of diabetes and metabolic syndrome. \n\nThe GluCare team is looking to expand their successful business model from physical interaction to service in the cloud. This new offering will be called Zone.Health. The ask is to build a website that acts as the hub of information in order to get patients to join their program. The various sections of the site will consist of: \n\nâ€¢\tâ—  What is Zone.health? \nâ€¢\tâ—  The program \nâ€¢\tâ—  Why it works? \nâ€¢\tâ—  Join now \nâ€¢\tâ—  Pricing \nâ€¢\tâ—  FAQs \n\nWe envisage the website to have an onboarding portal which will consist of three parts, an API, a CMS and a Frontend system.\n\n1.\tThis will allow for future integration into other customer touch points should the need arise. The onboarding journey will consist of: \n\n1) BMI calculator\n\nIf less 27, show a message to say that they donâ€™t qualify. If greater 27, take the user through the registration flow. \n\n2) Registration (numerous inputs)\n\nOnce the patient has provided the above, they will be visible within the custom built CMS. The practitioner will have a login to the CMS whereby they will be able to view the information captured by the patient. They would be able to add specific notes after the consultation and select the medication and the required gear (glucose monitor, wearable and scale) to send to the patient. The idea is that the cost of these items will be built into the system, so that the practitioner can simply select the products, which then creates the payment link. This will be centrally managed in its totality in the CMS. \nOnce the payment has been made, the kit will be delivered to the patient and the engagement with Zone.Health will be through the app. However, each month, the practitioner will log into the CMS and create a payment link based on the progress the patient is making. \n\nAll invoices and orders will be available to the patient when logging into the site. It is important to note that the onboarding portal and the mobile app (this has been developed separately and not in the scope of this project) should use the same authentication system in order to prevent the patient having to create two seperate accounts. \nDetails will be provided once engagement starts, but we expect the website to consist of:\n\no\tâ—  Project set up \no\tâ—  Information website build \no\tâ—  BMI \no\tâ—  Registration \no\tâ—  Further screening questions \no\tâ—  Laboratory Test Uploads \no\tâ—  Schedule a visit \no\tâ—  Confirmation \no\tâ—  Payment Process \no\tâ—  Account Settings \no\tâ—  CMS - View users \no\tâ—  CMS - Create payments \no\tâ—  CMS - Shipment of your ZoneHealth kit notification \no\tâ—  Email Templates Creation \no\tâ—  Email Provider Integration \no\tâ—  CRM Integration \no\tâ—  Scheduling System Integration \no\tâ—  Payment Provider Integration \nVideo Conferencing Integration \n\nThere are similar businesses in the US and we like this the most: https://joinfound.com\n\n",

        "description": "GluCare was born out of the idea that a combination of a human-centric patient approach and a technology working together will lead to a better and more efficient management of diabetes and metabolic syndrome. \n\nThe GluCare team is looking to expand their successful business model from physical interaction to service in the cloud. This new offering will be called Zone.Health. The ask is to build a website that acts as the hub of information in order to get patients to join their program. The various sections of the site will consist of: \n\nâ€¢\tâ—  What is Zone.health? \nâ€¢\tâ—  The program \nâ€¢\tâ—  Why it works? \nâ€¢\tâ—  Join now \nâ€¢\tâ—  Pricing \nâ€¢\tâ—  FAQs \n\nWe envisage the website to have an onboarding portal which will consist of three parts, an API, a CMS and a Frontend system.\n\n1.\tThis will allow for future integration into other customer touch points should the need arise. The onboarding journey will consist of: \n\n1) BMI calculator\n\nIf less 27, show a message to say that they donâ€™t qualify. If greater 27, take the user through the registration flow. \n\n2) Registration (numerous inputs)\n\nOnce the patient has provided the above, they will be visible within the custom built CMS. The practitioner will have a login to the CMS whereby they will be able to view the information captured by the patient. They would be able to add specific notes after the consultation and select the medication and the required gear (glucose monitor, wearable and scale) to send to the patient. The idea is that the cost of these items will be built into the system, so that the practitioner can simply select the products, which then creates the payment link. This will be centrally managed in its totality in the CMS. \nOnce the payment has been made, the kit will be delivered to the patient and the engagement with Zone.Health will be through the app. However, each month, the practitioner will log into the CMS and create a payment link based on the progress the patient is making. \n\nAll invoices and orders will be available to the patient when logging into the site. It is important to note that the onboarding portal and the mobile app (this has been developed separately and not in the scope of this project) should use the same authentication system in order to prevent the patient having to create two seperate accounts. \nDetails will be provided once engagement starts, but we expect the website to consist of:\n\no\tâ—  Project set up \no\tâ—  Information website build \no\tâ—  BMI \no\tâ—  Registration \no\tâ—  Further screening questions \no\tâ—  Laboratory Test Uploads \no\tâ—  Schedule a visit \no\tâ—  Confirmation \no\tâ—  Payment Process \no\tâ—  Account Settings \no\tâ—  CMS - View users \no\tâ—  CMS - Create payments \no\tâ—  CMS - Shipment of your ZoneHealth kit notification \no\tâ—  Email Templates Creation \no\tâ—  Email Provider Integration \no\tâ—  CRM Integration \no\tâ—  Scheduling System Integration \no\tâ—  Payment Provider Integration \nVideo Conferencing Integration \n\nThere are similar businesses in the US and we like this the most: https://joinfound.com\n\n",

I would like a freelancer to propose a price for this work.  \n\nAt the site users log in with a username and password that I provide. The project to which they are assigned opens and user then adds one or more comments. There are multiple projects and multiple users so that login credentials ensures that the user accesses the correct project. I have admin rights on the site to set up projects, set up users, assign users to projects and download data collected. I need to make clear that I am not a website administrator, nor do I have deep skills in the technology. While I am tech savvy in a number of areas, and I have managed many tech development projects through Upwork and the predecessor companies. The freelancer will need to communicate with me at my level of understanding. \n\nThe site has not been used much recently and the code is now out of date. Most parts of the site seem to work ok except when a user logs in, their project does not open. I need a freelancer to review the code and update the site (patches, fixes, etc.). I do not need a redesign or new functionality; I only need the code updated. I do have more detailed documentation that I can share with freelancers that are shortlisted. The freelancer who created the site did great work but they are not available at this time so I need a new freelancer who can do this work. \n\nI have accounts on Heroku and Vercel to support this site and the below is a brief summary of the documentation from the freelancer that created the project.\nLIBRARIES &amp; FRAMEWORKS ON THE FRONT END\nReact JS - React is an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components.\nNext JS â€“ Was used to build server-side rendering and static web applications using React.\nStyled-Components â€“ This utilizes tagged template literals to style the components.\nMaterial-UI - React components for faster and easier web development.\nJs-Cookie â€“ Is a simple, lightweight JavaScript API for handling browser cookies, this was used to read the cookie token stored in the browser and was used for authenticating users as soon as they are signed in using the form on the application.\nIsormorphic-Fetch - Isomorphic-fetch is implementation of fetch for both Node.js and browser, this was used to communicate with the backend (server) and used to fetch data stored on the server database and pulled to the frontend.\nThe rest of the libraries/frameworks can be found in the package.json file on the root directory of the project. Any developer that will be doing further work on the project can find the documentation on the README.MD file on the GitHub page useful and straightforward.\n\nLIBRARIES &amp; FRAMEWORKS ON THE BACK END\nNode JS â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side.\nExpress JS â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side.\nMongoose â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code \nJson2cvs â€“ Node.js (Node) is an open-source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side.\n\n\n \n",

        "description": "GluCare was born out of the idea that a combination of a human-centric patient approach and a technology working together will lead to a better and more efficient management of diabetes and metabolic syndrome. \n\nThe GluCare team is looking to expand their successful business model from physical interaction to service in the cloud. This new offering will be called Zone.Health. The ask is to build a website that acts as the hub of information in order to get patients to join their program. The various sections of the site will consist of: \n\nâ€¢\tâ—  What is Zone.health? \nâ€¢\tâ—  The program \nâ€¢\tâ—  Why it works? \nâ€¢\tâ—  Join now \nâ€¢\tâ—  Pricing \nâ€¢\tâ—  FAQs \n\nWe envisage the website to have an onboarding portal which will consist of three parts, an API, a CMS and a Frontend system.\n\n1.\tThis will allow for future integration into other customer touch points should the need arise. The onboarding journey will consist of: \n\n1) BMI calculator\n\nIf less 27, show a message to say that they donâ€™t qualify. If greater 27, take the user through the registration flow. \n\n2) Registration (numerous inputs)\n\nOnce the patient has provided the above, they will be visible within the custom built CMS. The practitioner will have a login to the CMS whereby they will be able to view the information captured by the patient. They would be able to add specific notes after the consultation and select the medication and the required gear (glucose monitor, wearable and scale) to send to the patient. The idea is that the cost of these items will be built into the system, so that the practitioner can simply select the products, which then creates the payment link. This will be centrally managed in its totality in the CMS. \nOnce the payment has been made, the kit will be delivered to the patient and the engagement with Zone.Health will be through the app. However, each month, the practitioner will log into the CMS and create a payment link based on the progress the patient is making. \n\nAll invoices and orders will be available to the patient when logging into the site. It is important to note that the onboarding portal and the mobile app (this has been developed separately and not in the scope of this project) should use the same authentication system in order to prevent the patient having to create two seperate accounts. \nDetails will be provided once engagement starts, but we expect the website to consist of:\n\no\tâ—  Project set up \no\tâ—  Information website build \no\tâ—  BMI \no\tâ—  Registration \no\tâ—  Further screening questions \no\tâ—  Laboratory Test Uploads \no\tâ—  Schedule a visit \no\tâ—  Confirmation \no\tâ—  Payment Process \no\tâ—  Account Settings \no\tâ—  CMS - View users \no\tâ—  CMS - Create payments \no\tâ—  CMS - Shipment of your ZoneHealth kit notification \no\tâ—  Email Templates Creation \no\tâ—  Email Provider Integration \no\tâ—  CRM Integration \no\tâ—  Scheduling System Integration \no\tâ—  Payment Provider Integration \nVideo Conferencing Integration \n\nThere are similar businesses in the US and we like this the most: https://joinfound.com\n\n",

        "description": "GluCare was born out of the idea that a combination of a human-centric patient approach and a technology working together will lead to a better and more efficient management of diabetes and metabolic syndrome. \n\nThe GluCare team is looking to expand their successful business model from physical interaction to service in the cloud. This new offering will be called Zone.Health. The ask is to build a website that acts as the hub of information in order to get patients to join their program. The various sections of the site will consist of: \n\nâ€¢\tâ—  What is Zone.health? \nâ€¢\tâ—  The program \nâ€¢\tâ—  Why it works? \nâ€¢\tâ—  Join now \nâ€¢\tâ—  Pricing \nâ€¢\tâ—  FAQs \n\nWe envisage the website to have an onboarding portal which will consist of three parts, an API, a CMS and a Frontend system.\n\n1.\tThis will allow for future integration into other customer touch points should the need arise. The onboarding journey will consist of: \n\n1) BMI calculator\n\nIf less 27, show a message to say that they donâ€™t qualify. If greater 27, take the user through the registration flow. \n\n2) Registration (numerous inputs)\n\nOnce the patient has provided the above, they will be visible within the custom built CMS. The practitioner will have a login to the CMS whereby they will be able to view the information captured by the patient. They would be able to add specific notes after the consultation and select the medication and the required gear (glucose monitor, wearable and scale) to send to the patient. The idea is that the cost of these items will be built into the system, so that the practitioner can simply select the products, which then creates the payment link. This will be centrally managed in its totality in the CMS. \nOnce the payment has been made, the kit will be delivered to the patient and the engagement with Zone.Health will be through the app. However, each month, the practitioner will log into the CMS and create a payment link based on the progress the patient is making. \n\nAll invoices and orders will be available to the patient when logging into the site. It is important to note that the onboarding portal and the mobile app (this has been developed separately and not in the scope of this project) should use the same authentication system in order to prevent the patient having to create two seperate accounts. \nDetails will be provided once engagement starts, but we expect the website to consist of:\n\no\tâ—  Project set up \no\tâ—  Information website build \no\tâ—  BMI \no\tâ—  Registration \no\tâ—  Further screening questions \no\tâ—  Laboratory Test Uploads \no\tâ—  Schedule a visit \no\tâ—  Confirmation \no\tâ—  Payment Process \no\tâ—  Account Settings \no\tâ—  CMS - View users \no\tâ—  CMS - Create payments \no\tâ—  CMS - Shipment of your ZoneHealth kit notification \no\tâ—  Email Templates Creation \no\tâ—  Email Provider Integration \no\tâ—  CRM Integration \no\tâ—  Scheduling System Integration \no\tâ—  Payment Provider Integration \nVideo Conferencing Integration \n\nThere are similar businesses in the US and we like this the most: https://joinfound.com\n\n",

        "description": "GluCare was born out of the idea that a combination of a human-centric patient approach and a technology working together will lead to a better and more efficient management of diabetes and metabolic syndrome. \n\nThe GluCare team is looking to expand their successful business model from physical interaction to service in the cloud. This new offering will be called Zone.Health. The ask is to build a website that acts as the hub of information in order to get patients to join their program. The various sections of the site will consist of: \n\nâ€¢\tâ—  What is Zone.health? \nâ€¢\tâ—  The program \nâ€¢\tâ—  Why it works? \nâ€¢\tâ—  Join now \nâ€¢\tâ—  Pricing \nâ€¢\tâ—  FAQs \n\nWe envisage the website to have an onboarding portal which will consist of three parts, an API, a CMS and a Frontend system.\n\n1.\tThis will allow for future integration into other customer touch points should the need arise. The onboarding journey will consist of: \n\n1) BMI calculator\n\nIf less 27, show a message to say that they donâ€™t qualify. If greater 27, take the user through the registration flow. \n\n2) Registration (numerous inputs)\n\nOnce the patient has provided the above, they will be visible within the custom built CMS. The practitioner will have a login to the CMS whereby they will be able to view the information captured by the patient. They would be able to add specific notes after the consultation and select the medication and the required gear (glucose monitor, wearable and scale) to send to the patient. The idea is that the cost of these items will be built into the system, so that the practitioner can simply select the products, which then creates the payment link. This will be centrally managed in its totality in the CMS. \nOnce the payment has been made, the kit will be delivered to the patient and the engagement with Zone.Health will be through the app. However, each month, the practitioner will log into the CMS and create a payment link based on the progress the patient is making. \n\nAll invoices and orders will be available to the patient when logging into the site. It is important to note that the onboarding portal and the mobile app (this has been developed separately and not in the scope of this project) should use the same authentication system in order to prevent the patient having to create two seperate accounts. \nDetails will be provided once engagement starts, but we expect the website to consist of:\n\no\tâ—  Project set up \no\tâ—  Information website build \no\tâ—  BMI \no\tâ—  Registration \no\tâ—  Further screening questions \no\tâ—  Laboratory Test Uploads \no\tâ—  Schedule a visit \no\tâ—  Confirmation \no\tâ—  Payment Process \no\tâ—  Account Settings \no\tâ—  CMS - View users \no\tâ—  CMS - Create payments \no\tâ—  CMS - Shipment of your ZoneHealth kit notification \no\tâ—  Email Templates Creation \no\tâ—  Email Provider Integration \no\tâ—  CRM Integration \no\tâ—  Scheduling System Integration \no\tâ—  Payment Provider Integration \nVideo Conferencing Integration \n\nThere are similar businesses in the US and we like this the most: https://joinfound.com\n\n",

        "description": "I have a 3D modding application for Final Fantasy VII, and itâ€™s missing critical animation tools. The main things I think it's missing are a Gizmo to move and rotate joints in 3D space, animation splines to make adjustments to direction and speed, and a real animation bar at the bottom displaying your key frames and etc. It's also lacking automatic interpolation between the keys so you can play test the animation without manually adding additional frames, this makes it much harder if you need an animation\nto stay within a certain number of frames. The app has an animation retargeting feature, but it could probably be rounded out a bit more to work more like Maya or Unreal. If possible, it would be helpful to make the app platform agnostic so it can work on both Windows and Mac. If thatâ€™s too much reworking, then maybe just a Mac version as well. This isnâ€™t an absolute necessity, I currently use the app with Wine, but an app that can work natively would be much better. \n\nI didnâ€™t set a budget because Iâ€™m not sure what something like this would cost, and I didnâ€™t want to discourage anyone from applying. If youâ€™re interested let me know what you think, and how much you think you could complete this for. \n\nThe source code and application is here: \n\nhttps://github.com/LaZar00/KimeraCS\n",

        "description": "GluCare was born out of the idea that a combination of a human-centric patient approach and a technology working together will lead to a better and more efficient management of diabetes and metabolic syndrome. \n\nThe GluCare team is looking to expand their successful business model from physical interaction to service in the cloud. This new offering will be called Zone.Health. The ask is to build a website that acts as the hub of information in order to get patients to join their program. The various sections of the site will consist of: \n\nâ€¢\tâ—  What is Zone.health? \nâ€¢\tâ—  The program \nâ€¢\tâ—  Why it works? \nâ€¢\tâ—  Join now \nâ€¢\tâ—  Pricing \nâ€¢\tâ—  FAQs \n\nWe envisage the website to have an onboarding portal which will consist of three parts, an API, a CMS and a Frontend system.\n\n1.\tThis will allow for future integration into other customer touch points should the need arise. The onboarding journey will consist of: \n\n1) BMI calculator\n\nIf less 27, show a message to say that they donâ€™t qualify. If greater 27, take the user through the registration flow. \n\n2) Registration (numerous inputs)\n\nOnce the patient has provided the above, they will be visible within the custom built CMS. The practitioner will have a login to the CMS whereby they will be able to view the information captured by the patient. They would be able to add specific notes after the consultation and select the medication and the required gear (glucose monitor, wearable and scale) to send to the patient. The idea is that the cost of these items will be built into the system, so that the practitioner can simply select the products, which then creates the payment link. This will be centrally managed in its totality in the CMS. \nOnce the payment has been made, the kit will be delivered to the patient and the engagement with Zone.Health will be through the app. However, each month, the practitioner will log into the CMS and create a payment link based on the progress the patient is making. \n\nAll invoices and orders will be available to the patient when logging into the site. It is important to note that the onboarding portal and the mobile app (this has been developed separately and not in the scope of this project) should use the same authentication system in order to prevent the patient having to create two seperate accounts. \nDetails will be provided once engagement starts, but we expect the website to consist of:\n\no\tâ—  Project set up \no\tâ—  Information website build \no\tâ—  BMI \no\tâ—  Registration \no\tâ—  Further screening questions \no\tâ—  Laboratory Test Uploads \no\tâ—  Schedule a visit \no\tâ—  Confirmation \no\tâ—  Payment Process \no\tâ—  Account Settings \no\tâ—  CMS - View users \no\tâ—  CMS - Create payments \no\tâ—  CMS - Shipment of your ZoneHealth kit notification \no\tâ—  Email Templates Creation \no\tâ—  Email Provider Integration \no\tâ—  CRM Integration \no\tâ—  Scheduling System Integration \no\tâ—  Payment Provider Integration \nVideo Conferencing Integration \n\nThere are similar businesses in the US and we like this the most: https://joinfound.com\n\n",

        "description": "I have a 3D modding application for Final Fantasy VII, and itâ€™s missing critical animation tools. The main things I think it's missing are a Gizmo to move and rotate joints in 3D space, animation splines to make adjustments to direction and speed, and a real animation bar at the bottom displaying your key frames and etc. It's also lacking automatic interpolation between the keys so you can play test the animation without manually adding additional frames, this makes it much harder if you need an animation\nto stay within a certain number of frames. The app has an animation retargeting feature, but it could probably be rounded out a bit more to work more like Maya or Unreal. If possible, it would be helpful to make the app platform agnostic so it can work on both Windows and Mac. If thatâ€™s too much reworking, then maybe just a Mac version as well. This isnâ€™t an absolute necessity, I currently use the app with Wine, but an app that can work natively would be much better. \n\nI didnâ€™t set a budget because Iâ€™m not sure what something like this would cost, and I didnâ€™t want to discourage anyone from applying. If youâ€™re interested let me know what you think, and how much you think you could complete this for. \n\nThe source code and application is here: \n\nhttps://github.com/LaZar00/KimeraCS\n",
